memo: True
to: "Judith Kelley, Tim Büthe, Timur Kuran, and Giovanna Merli"
...

Now that we have a full committee and are working on scheduling the prospectus defense, it's definitely crunch time. In this short memo I'll (1) explain the current committee structure, (2) discuss the latest iteration of my hypotheses and theoretical framework, and (3) list my next steps. 


# A full committee, finally!

Giovanna Merli from the Sanford School has agreed to be the 4th member of the committee. She has extensive experience doing research in China and knows the region well, and I look forward to her insights, feedback, and advice. 

With Giovanna, the committee now has experts in non-state international institutions and global governance (Judith and Tim), evolutionary institutionalism (Timur), the Middle East (Timur), and China (Giovanna). No member of the committee has expertise in either of the issue areas (freedom of expression and education), but Ken Rogerson will informally provide me with assistance on freedom of expression issues, and I will find faculty at other universities with education schools for more advice. 


# Hypotheses and implications, revised 

Our last committee meeting was extraordinarily useful for the development of my theory and research design. In particular, the 3×3 matrix we thought up provided a useful organizing framework for the different behaviors I'm hoping to study.

I have spent the past couple weeks refining my two main research questions, which are currently: 

1. How do authoritarian regimes relate to international NGOs that work in their countries?
2. How do international NGOs respond to the domestic politics of the countries they target?

I have also worked on revising and refining the matrix, creating categories for authoritarian strategies and INGO responses (see Figure 1). I expect authoritarian regimes to have one of three broad policies towards international NGOs working in their regimes: (1) *tolerance*, or very few legal or actual restrictions on any activities, (2) *constraint*, or restrictions ranging from minor legal hurdles to major oppression or intimidation, and (3) *expulsion*, or the complete banning of all INGO activities. I will argue that this policy varies in response to numerous factors, including the type of issue area the INGO advocates (i.e. some types of advocacy or service provision will be more contentious than others, leading to different regime policies) and the dynamics of the domestic politics within the country (i.e. the threat of the opposition winning in an upcoming election, social unrest, ethnic conflict, etc.). 

![Working theoretical framework](working_theory.pdf)

Contrary to previous iterations of this framework, I do not believe that the regime necessarily responds to INGO activities. Instead, regimes set policies that help with their institutional balancing, limiting organizations and sectors that could pose a threat to stability and co-opting those that could help offset the threats of other institutional challengers. What I hope to determine are the conditions under which a regime will shift its policies towards non-state actors like global civil society—the actions of individual NGOs likely have little weight in that calculus.

In contrast, I believe that INGOs *do* behave in response to the limits imposed by authoritarian policies and politics. I expect INGOs to react in one of three general ways: (1) *compliance*, or tolerating and cooperating with the legal limits imposed by the regime, (2) *mitigation*, or creatively working around those policies to continue their work, and (3) *antagonism*, or ignoring and resisting those policies. Under compliance and mitigation, I expect INGOs to make adjustments to their programming and strategies to remain within the legal bounds set by the regime. The amount of variation in these programming shifts depends on the strictness of the regime's INGO policies as well as the INGO's principled and instrumental concerns (i.e. the tradeoff between staying true to some underlying normative mission vs. being able to actually pursue that mission in country).

The behavior of both authoritarian regimes and INGOs are thus theoretically linked: regimes choose from a menu of regulation options based on (1) the nature of INGO programming and (2) domestic politics (see Table 1), and INGOs respond according to the (1) type of regime policy imposed on them and (2) balance between their normative principled and instrumental concerns (see Table 2).

As discussed in previous memos (and as will be discussed in the prospectus), I will test this framework by looking at freedom of expression INGOs and education INGOs working in the Middle East and China.


# What I'm planning on doing in the next two weeks

* Set a final date for the prospectus defense.
* Send a draft prospectus to Judith for initial feedback.
* Incorporate her feedback and send improved draft to full committee.
