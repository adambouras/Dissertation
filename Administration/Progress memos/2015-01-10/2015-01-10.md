# The squiggle of research

My favorite visual metaphor for the design process (be it graphic design or research design) is the squiggle below:^[Damien Newman, "That Squiggle of the Design Process," [http://v2.centralstory.com/about/squiggle/](http://v2.centralstory.com/about/squiggle/)]

![The Design Squiggle](design_squiggle.pdf)

Initial forays into any project are always fraught with dead ends, windy roads, backtracking, and confusion, but over time all that mess evolves into something with clarity and a clear focus. 

For me, the dissertation prospectus process thus far has followed this exact course. I'm still very much in the messy research phase, though I'm hopefully done with any backward progress. Before providing standard updates on my progress thus far, I begin this memo^[Five weeks late thanks to the holidays! Sorry!] with an explanation of some of the evolution of my thinking about my dissertation. I received extremely useful feedback from Judith and from Tim's group of PhD students, and this evolution reflects those comments.

# How the project has evolved

Previously, I had identified three broad questions that I could potentially answer related to the triangular relationship between authoritarian regimes, domestic civil society organizations within those countries, and international NGOs interested in working in those countries:

1. What determines when an authoritarian regime will crack down on INGOs? (*addressing how authoritarian regimes deal with INGOs*)
2. What determines when INGOs accommodate obey those legal restrictions, oppose government intrusions into organizational practices, or pull out of the country entirely? (*addressing how INGOs deal with authoritarian regimes*)
3. Under what conditions will collaboration between domestic and transnational NGOs be successful in authoritarian regimes? (*addressing how INGOs and domestic NGOs work with each other*)

I planned on potentially answering these three questions using a variety of methods, including (1) machine learning and natural language text processing to generate a measure of *de facto* and *de jure* INGO restrictions based on event data or corpora of text, and (2) deep qualitative work on a handful of carefully selected INGOs working in a carefully selected subset of authoritarian countries.

## Issues I've run into

Text analysis is messy and hard. I so far have not found a good way to systematically, algorithmically, and robustly code authoritarian restrictions on INGOs. I have two potential categories of corpora for discovering restrictions: (1) event data based on news reports, and (2) extraction of latent topics from INGO reports. Each of these types of text pose difficult challenges. 

Event data methods are becoming more refined and precise all the time, but the field of event data is currently stuck in an awkward limbo. Before 2013, event data was largely proprietary and expensive, available only through Department of Defense contracts or commercial licenses. A free and open source alternative named GDELT was launched in 2013, but it collapsed in January 2014 because of legal issues. The Open Event Data alliance emerged in its wake, promising to provide all its data processing algorithms *and* its final data as open source. The OED has done so and has made spectacular progress. I've been able to parse articles that I have already download (the three English-language Egyptian newspapers I've used in previous projects), and I can process daily events for 100+ newspapers starting today (and every day after). However, the value of event data is in its massive quantity. The two years of coverage I have with my Egyptian archives don't provide extraordinarily useful data—for better value, I need more years of coverage from more newspapers. However, going back in time is technically and legally tricky. The OED has been collecting daily data since last summer and is working on processing historical archives back to the 1970s, but it will be a while until that data is ready. I could theoretically find my own massive newspaper archives and download and parse them (like I did with the Egyptian archives), but it would take a really long time and is legally dubious. So *open* event data as a method is unfortunately not mature enough for me to use yet. I may be able to get around these limitations by using commercial data like Amanda Murdie, providing Integrated Data for Event Analysis (IDEA) with a list of NGOs and getting data from their proprietary black box algorithms, but this is expensive and less than ideal. 

The second option I have for measuring INGO restrictions is to parse a corpus of non-news text specifically related to restrictions, such as reports by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the State Department, or the International Center for Nonprofit Law (ICNL). However, beyond ICNL, none of these organizations issue regular reports specifically focused on regime-organization relations. Instead, topics range from human rights abuses of specific activists to general deficiencies in human rights legislation and implementation. ICNL country reports contain a wealth of summary data, but the organization does not keep historical data—they make updates to their country profiles in place, so each report represents the most recent version. I could get past versions of the reports with Google's cache or by looking at Archive.org snapshots of those pages, but the changes are typically very incremental (a sentence or two changed at a time) and might not provide enough variance over time—that is, the 2011 and 2014 versions of a page might be too similar to get anything useful out of it to create good panel data. I can still get a measure of restrictiveness for 2014, but it is unlikely that I can get anything historical.

Thus, as they stand now, text-based methods are too immature to be used exclusively in my dissertation. I still really want to use them to some degree, but definitely not as the centerpiece of my research.


## Potential narrowing of issue areas

Because of the qualitative data roadblocks I'm facing, I've spent the past few weeks addressing one of the most common criticisms with my nascent proposal—I have yet to define which types of INGOs and which issue areas and policies I intend to research. Additionally, it may be wise to narrow down my dissertation research to just one of the three broad questions, leaving the other two for my future research agenda. I need to narrow my research questions and connect them to specific policy issues, which means I need to have a more focused research design. Specifically, I hope to address 2–3 issue areas in 2–3 countries or regions, looking at both the whole INGO sector broadly and 3 INGOs in detail.

What interested me about the relationship between international NGOs and authoritarian regimes in the first place, and why I have been so interested in this topic, is an experience I had while working on my first MA in Egypt in 2008–2010. Christian churches and organizations are highly regulated throughout the Middle East and there is a lot of variability between countries. LDS Charities is a worldwide humanitarian relief organization run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (or Mormons) that provides a variety of aid, including neonatal resuscitation training, wheelchair delivery, eye exams, disaster relief, and assistance to local NGOs such as orphanages and leprosariums. The LDS church occasionally faces difficulties securing legal permission for LDS Charities to operate, often because government officials are concerned that the organization is a front for religious proselytization (it is explicitly not, however).

In the 2000s, the church worked with the Mubarak regime to allow LDS Charities to formally register as a charity. Year after year, President Mubarak would signal his approval, but he regularly deferred his decision to his Coptic Christian council, who would regularly deny the request. Approval was finally granted around 2007 after years of legal negotiations. Seeing this process firsthand was a puzzle. Why did Mubarak, the ostensible omnipotent dictator, defer to his Christian advisors? Couldn't he have just approved the application on his own? Egypt wasn't a democracy—why the deference? 

It is most likely that the Mubarak regime used LDS Charities and other humanitarian INGOs as pawns in domestic politics. Coptic Christians account for 10–15% of Egypt's population and are both politically active and fearful of persecution. By giving Coptic leaders some say in trivial decisions, Mubarak could, in a way, placate them and help maintain the stability of his regime. Copts, in turn, appeared threatened by foreign Christian groups that could change the balance of Eastern Christian dominance in the country, and thus did not want more Western Christian organizations to work in the country. 

I've long wondered when this pattern—dictators using INGOs as pawns in domestic politics—holds true in other issue areas. What kinds of INGOs are more susceptible to regime capture? Which ones are more resistant? When do the INGOs adjust their missions and strategies to fit better in the countries they work in?

Though my first exposure to INGOs in domestic politics was LDS Charities, I was hesitant to look at faith-based INGOs since my general impression (however wrong it may be) is that religious studies in political science and public policy is somewhat of an academic ghetto (perhaps more so than area studies). However, following Tim's suggestion, I looked more closely into the scholarship on faith-based INGOs (or FBINGOs, for lack of a better term). There isn't much at all. Some research has looked at the political role of churches, such as Guillermo Trejo's research on religious competition and ethnic mobilization in rural Mexico [-@Trejo:2012], but I have found nothing about the politics of charitable organizations that don't explicitly proselyte or provide religious services, such as Catholic Relief Services, LDS Charities, or Islamic Relief Worldwide. 

In addition to charitable religious INGOs, I am also very interested in organizations that lobby for freedom of expression issues, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)—organizations that lobby in court cases against journalists, activists, and bloggers and advocate for human rights legislation in countries both authoritarian and democratic. EFF, for example, does a lot of work in the US against restrictive copyright laws and cybersecurity issues, but also does significant international advocacy for threatened activists. There is little research on the international politics of these kinds of advocacy organizations—most research looks at general human rights organizations like Amnesty and HRW, or at more traditional political issues like election monitoring.

One of the suggestions I received in the feedback from the last iteration of this proposal was that I look at a selection of INGOs across a few issue areas that vary along some variable or characteristic. These issue areas are not just policy issues I find interesting—they fit into a larger theoretical hunch I have. An explanation for why and how authoritarian regimes treat INGOs differently may be the level of saliency of the issue areas these organizations tackle, or the level of potential threat they pose to the regime. FBINGOs generally have less desire to change or influence politics and are instead more focused on providing aid, and are thus perhaps more susceptible to organization- and mission-level adjustments and changes in response to authoritarian desires. In contrast, freedom of expression INGOs lobby and advocate directly in domestic politics and might be more resistant to authoritarian influence.

This continuum of saliency is based in part on research done by @Yerkes:2012 and @Hildebrandt:2013, who conduct in-depth research on domestic human rights and humanitarian NGOs in Egypt and China. Yerkes argues that domestic civil society organizations will either be captured, co-opted, or permitted by the regime depending on the amount of outside rhetorical support (i.e. international sponsors or advocates), the level of perceived threat to the regime, and access to foreign funding. Similarly, Hildebrandt argues that domestic social organizations in China are either oppressed or co-opted based on the number of political opportunity structures available to NGOs—those with more autonomy and opportunity are more likely to be repressed. 

However, neither of these newer works address the dynamics of international NGOs. The potential outcomes are probably similar: an INGO might be repressed, captured, co-opted, permitted to operate, or deported, but the mechanisms leading to those outcomes are likely more complicated. And I can discover them.

My case-based approach is modeled, to some extent, on Charli Carpenter's new book *Lost Causes* [-@Carpenter:2014]. In her book, Carpenter supports her argument with in-depth case studies of NGOs working on unrelated issue areas, including wartime victim compensation, automated weapons (or "killer robots"), and male circumcision. I offer a general overview of my own approach in Figure 2, proposing to look at religious humanitarian charitable aid, freedom of expression INGOs, and possibly a third issue (depending on how my theory develops), looking at foreign-based INGOs that do humanitarian and advocacy work in China and the Middle East (perhaps just one country, like Tunisia or Egypt, or perhaps the region in general). 

![General research design](basic_research_design.pdf)

For each issue area, I would provide a broad analysis of all the organizations in that sector. For example, I would create a dataset of FBINGOs based on lists in the Yearbook of International Organizations and other databases I identified previously. After conducting a sector-wide survey (or some other sort of analysis), I would then select three organizations as cases, conducting interviews and archival research to see how these groups deal with authoritarian regimes. I would also use text-based quantitative methods to bolster my analysis, processing sector or organization reports and news releases to find latent patterns.


# What I'm planning on doing next

Here's what I'll do in the next three weeks:^[And it will really only be three weeks this time, really :)]

* Plan a meeting of the full committee for sometime in late January
* Identify a 4th committee member
* Present this evolved research plan to the public policy prospectus seminar and to Tim's PhD student group
* Begin collecting lists of FBINGOs and freedom of expression NGOs
* Read @MitchellSchmitz:2014, @BloodgoodSchmitz:2013, @Hildebrandt:2013, and @Teets:2014. 
* Begin specifying more specific research questions and hypotheses so I can move beyond general case selection and start developing survey and interview instruments.
* Investigate Syracuse's Transnational NGO Initiative ([https://www1.maxwell.syr.edu/Moynihan_TNGO.asp](https://www1.maxwell.syr.edu/Moynihan_TNGO.asp)) and look at their survey instruments and interview protocols.
