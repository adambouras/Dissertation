Two issue areas, 3 INGOs in each

# Religious humanitarian aid

* LDS Charities
* Catholic Relief Services
* International Islamic Relief Organization or Islamic Relief Worldwide

Category I = F in YIO (also G; IIRO is G)

# Human rights advocacy

Election monitoring + human trafficking as background information (look through human trafficking survey data on the questions I asked)

Freedom of expression stuff? EFF?


Hypotheses: 

* Humanitarian organizations X
* Advocacy organizations more likely to be kicked out

Think of some cool taxonomy like cooptation, capture, etc. from Yerkes


Look in YIO to get a list of all religious humanitarian organizations. Make a dataset like Tana's organizational progeny, do similar things with it

Chapter on the backgrounds, histories, missions, work of each of the six organizations

Find organizations that meet each of the possible outcomes (exit, adaptation, avoidance, whatever)




Large FBINGOs, not small ones created by individual people of faith - organizations with institutional backing, like the official arms or churches or organizations defined exclusively by religion (like the Red Crescent)



# Poop from memo



Suggestion to look at countries with better data, like Jennifer Brass's work in Kenya (which is authoritarian), but the subset of those countries is limited.

Three broad questions - feedback from Judith and Tim's group of PhD students = narrow, focus on maybe just one - good questions, but too broadly stated now, not connected to specific policy issues


Found transnational NGO initiative at Syracuse with a collection of literature setting up a new agenda for research on INGOs

The Pope does political stuff (especially the new one); others remain neutral and don't get involved in local politics (LDS Charities); others are not outgrowths of centralized religious leaders (like IIRO), since there is none.




International NGOs - Yerkes and Hildebrant look at domestic NGOs in authoritarian regimes and come up with very similar typologies. How does that change when INGOs are involved? (51-52, 115-117?)

Policy area - interested in lots, most interested in dynamics and theory - look to diverging policy areas
Seawright paper on case selection - deviant and extreme cases
