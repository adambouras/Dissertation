# What I have done

Though I felt like I was perpetually and hopelessly behind, the past three weeks have been surprisingly quite productive. I completed most of the tasks I had assigned myself and received invaluable feedback from all of you, Tim's other PhD students, the students in Sandy Darrity's prospectus workshop, and Kendra Dupuy (another PhD student working on INGOs). Things are (hopefully?) starting to come together in a coherent way.

Most importantly, I spent time reading some of the most recent developments in INGO research and was able to better form my own nascent theory and research design based on these new findings. In this brief memo, I summarize this new literature and explain the evolution in my own thinking, concluding with a list of my next steps.


# What I have learned in the last three weeks

I came across Jessica Teets' new book in October last year and was excited to read it, given that it appeared to relate directly to my own work (the connection should be pretty obvious from the title: *Civil Society under Authoritarianism*). As you know, the overarching goal for this dissertation is to find out why INGOs work in authoritarian regimes and why those regimes let them. Given this, I became (justifiably) terrified when I read Teets' own motivating question: "Why would the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) allow a prominent independent group such as Greenpeace to exist?" [-@Teets:2014, 1]. That's my question! Fortunately, though, Teets does not approach the question from the same angle I had planned and she leaves many of the implications of her theory unexamined. Having now read the book, I don't think she duplicates any of my future research; rather, her work appears to be complementary to mine

Tweets lays out a theory of why authoritarian China has allowed certain types of INGOs in the country and how government officials deliberately learn from them in an effort to improve governance. She argues that Chinese bureaucrats follow a rational policy learning process who seek out and learn improved policies in response to deficiencies in existing policies and programs, thus leading to a form of endogenous institutional change. Government officials learn improved policies through either direct experience or observation of others' experiences with organizations that teach or provide examples of best practices in governance. Specifically, Teets finds that domestic and international civil society organizations "(1) [transmit] information and policy preferences through the experiences of partnering officials and (2) [share] best practices observed in other provinces/countries through epistemic communities," [-@Teets:2014, 23] thus providing bureaucrats with a bank of knowledge and resources to improve service delivery to their constituents.

However, in authoritarian contexts, these bureaucrats must carefully control this learning process to prevent policy evolution from undermining the stability of the regime. To do this, regimes (like China) adopt a new model of governance called "consultative authoritarianism," building regulatory structures that give some types of INGOs the freedom to operate and assist with governance while prohibiting others from fomenting dissent: that is, "local officials [seek] to balance the observed benefits of civil society groups in development with the potential danger of social mobilization by encouraging the formation of autonomous groups while developing a system of positive and negative incentives to guide group activities in desired directions" [@Teets:2014, 60].

In her book, Teets presents in-depth case studies of government bureaucrats working with environmental and public health INGOs in four Chinese provinces. While her findings are believable, I'm not sure how applicable they are to other policy areas or other countries. It is likely that China has wholeheartedly adopted the consultative authoritarian model for *some* sectors of transnational civil society (i.e. those that provide material benefit for bureaucrats, helping them meet performance targets), but in other sectors (such as human rights) are still heavily regulated and hardly consultative. Additionally, other regions such as the Middle East and Southeast Asia are still highly restrictive in most issue areas, including humanitarian aid. This may just be a uniquely Chinese phenomenon. Teets does not explain under which conditions consultative democracy will emerge, nor provide a model for predicting if and when a government might adopt less restrictive regulations for civil society, limiting the book's findings even further to only China.

However, I buy her theory (to some degree) and could test it, replicate it, and expand it in my own work, checking to see if it works in other issue areas (such as faith-based humanitarian aid and freedom of expression human rights organizations) or other countries (such as Egypt, Jordan, and Tunisia). 

Teets also approaches her research from the perspective of the government, conducting hundreds of interviews with local Chinese officials and only a few dozen with INGO members and employees. Her theory does not look at the agency of INGOs: if it is true that consulting with INGOs leads to authoritarian stability, why would an INGO concerned about democratization and human rights voluntarily consult with authoritarian leaders? When will INGOs get involved in a country? Do they have to balance any normative concerns of regime repression with their principles, missions, and values?

Studying INGOs themselves, rather than the countries they work in and the regimes they work with (or against), remains an understudied area of IR. Part of the reason for this is because INGOs are strange types of organizations and are thus difficult to research. Previous research has found that INGOs are driven by a set of normative principles and work to force states "toward normative convergence and international cooperation" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 488].^[See also the host of literature based on [@Keck:1998]] Others have found that INGOs instead behave as firms in a competitive market, driven by instrumental concerns of survival and strategy.^[See @Cooley:2002; @Bob:2002; among others.] Applying this divide to my own research, faith-based and freedom of expression INGOs might decide to work in an authoritarian regime either because (1) they believe that doing so will improve the lives of citizens in that country and hold the government accountable, or (2) they hope that doing so will raise global awareness of their own pet issues, create positive public relations and press coverage, and increase donations. 

To overcome this divide and provide a more unified theory of INGO behavior, @MitchellSchmitz:2014 present their own theory of "principled instrumentalism." Based on an impressive analysis of 152 US-registered INGOs, they argue that INGOs *are* driven largely by their principles, and that the economic, political, and competitive dynamics that other scholars have mistakenly taken as behavioral drivers serve as constraints to this principled behavior. That is, "organisations instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 489]. 

Unlike states or firms that generally face singular goals, like maximizing national security or maximizing profits, INGOs face a tradeoff between mission and money and must pursue both simultaneously. Mitchell and Schmitz present an elegant formal model to demonstrate how INGO effectiveness is a function of its mission, fundraising income, fundraising expenditures, and its budget. Organizations thus pursue different mixes of mission programming and fundraising income, subject to external constraints over time. Applying this idea to my own research, it is likely that faith-based and freedom of expression INGOs make decisions to get involved in a country because of normative concerns, but have to balance external issues that can reverse those decisions. For example, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has been involved in several legal cases for imprisoned bloggers and activists, but only in a handful of Middle Eastern nations—it is likely that government restrictions or limited funding confine what they are able to do and shape their strategies in responding to needs. Similarly, it is possible that organizations like Catholic Relief Services or LDS Charities are unwilling to get involved in authoritarian nations that place heavy restrictions on foreign funding, opting instead to place their limited resources in nations where they can get they biggest "bang for their humanitarian buck."


# How my project has evolved

Given the direction and findings of this newest research on INGOs and civil society in authoritarian contexts, I've spent the past few weeks refining my research questions and potential research design. While I do remain interested in how authoritarian regimes use domestic and international NGOs as pawns for regime stability, I face my own resource constraints for investigating those mechanisms in a dissertation.^[I don't speak Chinese and I don't have time to move to China and/or Egypt/Jordan/Tunisia for multiple years to interview reluctant government officials or uncover hidden troves of government data. However, Tim has usefully pointed out that other scholars (like Jennifer Brass, Amanda Murdie, and Kendra Dupuy) have been able to do some research on government responses to NGOs through creative methods—I just haven't found those creative methods yet.] Additionally, lots of work has been done (and continues to be done) from the perspective of authoritarian governments, while INGOs themselves are more understudied. Thus for this dissertation, I am drawn to the INGO side of the regime–NGO relationship.^[I have not abandoned the idea of studying regimes more directly, though. I foresee this triangular regime–INGO–domestic NGO relationship defining my research agenda in the future, and I'm finishing up a paper for ISA that uses a variety of indicators to predict authoritarian restrictions on freedom of expression and association.] Specifically, I hope to answer the following three specific questions:

1. Why do INGOs get involved in authoritarian regimes? Does "principled instrumentalism" hold up? How do they balance issues of mission and money?
2. When will INGOs get involved? Under what conditions will they enter (or not enter)? Do they only respond to exogenous events or address policy deficiencies (i.e. natural disasters, humanitarian crises, government oppression, activist arrests, etc.), or are there other reasons?
3. How do INGOs relate to or respond to the government in these countries? When do they consult with government officials to promote policy learning, cooperate with regulations on funding and activities, allow themselves (or prevent themselves) from being co-opted by the government, or get kicked out?^[I need another noun that starts with "c" if this is going to be a typology: consultation, cooperation, cooptation, kick-out-ation doesn't quite work :)]

I plan on answering these questions with a mixed-methods approach, combining in-depth qualitative case studies of particular faith-based humanitarian and freedom of expression advocacy INGOs with broader research on these two sectors as a whole. I briefly justify my case selection process and research design below (summarized graphically in Figure 1).

![Potential research design](research_design.pdf)

## Country/region selection

I'm planning on looking at INGOs that work in two regions: the Middle East and China. I do so for two reasons: (1) both are highly salient cases, given the rapid growth of civil society in China and China's prominent position in the global economy, and because of the tumultuous post-Arab Spring politics in the Middle East, and (2) both are excellent examples of authoritarian regimes behaving against naive assumptions of autocracy, as neither act like "traditional" autocracies where a dictator rules unilaterally (like North Korea or Cuba or other typical authoritarian regimes)—rather, both regions show signs of competitive "weird" authoritarianism, using seemingly democratic institutions to appear reformist while further entrenching regime stability. 

## Issue area selection

A common theme throughout all the research I have read on INGOs is that there is a fundamental difference between INGOs that engage in advocacy and those that provide humanitarian services. Advocacy NGOs inherently promote foreign norms and help push recalcitrant regimes towards a global consensus of rights [@Keck:1998; @Simmons:2009], while humanitarian NGOs fill gaps in service delivery, often as a result of natural disaster or persistent government neglect or ineptitude. Accordingly, authoritarian regimes treat the two sectors differently, generally placing more restrictions on advocacy organizations as these INGOS pose more of an existential threat than those providing services. Selecting issue areas in each of these sectors will allow me to see if INGO decision making varies according to broad sector, observing how external restrictions on funding differ by mission.

## Methods

In the course of arguing for principled instrumentalism, @MitchellSchmitz:2014 criticize existing studies of INGOs as being too focused on a handful of prominent organizations, resulting in findings and theories that are likely not very generalizable. For example, @Wong:2012 looks primarily at Amnesty International,^[Along with a ton of other people. People love to study Amnesty.] while @Stroup:2012 looks at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), CARE International, and Oxfam UK. Other INGO scholars have leveled similar critiques [@BloodgoodSchmitz:2013]. Mitchell and Schmitz recognize the utility of these in-depth case studies, but argue that more must be done—these case studies should be combined with large, more representative analyses to better understand the organizations that work in specific issue areas as a whole. @Kelley:2012 and @Buthe:2011 do this well, looking at the election monitoring INGO sector and the world of standards setting as a whole while also including more detailed studies of selected cases from those sectors. Judith's ongoing human trafficking work follows a similar pattern, surveying a broad swatch of the human trafficking INGO sector.

I plan to follow a similar approach. I will create a comprehensive database of all the INGOs that work in each of the two issue areas and conduct a sector-wide analysis likely through a survey, combined with other data collected on my own, like information from these organizations' 990 returns (if based in the US). I will then select 2–3 organizations from each sector as detailed cases and conduct archival research and semistructured interviews with their staff and management (ideally traveling to DC, London, Salt Lake City, and elsewhere as needed). 

Rather than focus my analysis on these INGOs in general, I plan on pegging my analysis to specific events. For example, I want to track different INGO responses to specific journalist arrests or specific humanitarian disasters (like earthquakes, landslides, etc.). Combining events with a list of all INGOs involved in each sector will allow me to create counterfactuals—using a list of the "usual suspects" I can identify which did or did not respond to specific needs (and which ones ordinarily would have), thus allowing me to investigate why. 

In addition to quantitative analysis of survey results and qualitative analysis of interviews, I can also augment my research with fancier methods like text-based computational text analysis (perhaps to look at large troves of archival material), agent-based modeling (to test the mathematical and game theoretical implications of my theory), or event data analysis since I have experience with them. 


# What I'm planning on doing next

* Meet with all three of you on February 5.
* Identify a 4th committee member.
* Schedule prospectus defense for the first half of April.
* Officially begin collecting data on faith-based humanitarian and freedom of expression advocacy INGOs.
* Determine how to answer the three "why," "when," and "how" questions. Do I develop potential theories to test (based on consultative authoritarianism and principled instrumentalism) or do I focus on more general deductive work, identifying mechanisms from a large body of results?
* Determine what my dependent variable is (NGO effectiveness? relations with the government?).
* Get a feel for INGO attitudes toward authoritarian regimes by conducting non-research interviews with staff members at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, LDS Charities, Catholic Relief Services, the Carter Center (because they were recently kicked out of Egypt), and the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies (because they were also just kicked out of Egypt).
* Read @BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014, @Brass:2012, @ButheMajorMello-e-Souza:2012, @ChahimPrakash:2014, @DupuyRonPrakash:2012, @DupuyRonPrakash:2015, and @Hildebrandt:2013.
