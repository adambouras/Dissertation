# What I have learned in the last three weeks

Or, more appropriately, how I have addressed issues with the last iteration of the proposal…

## Which perspective? 

During our full committee meeting a few weeks ago, we identified a few major problems with my nascent proposal. First, I moved too far in the direction on only studying INGOs, ignoring regime dynamics. I tried to justify this by saying that regimes are hard to study, as it can require extensive fieldwork and high-level elite interviews, as in @Teets:2014. However, as pointed out during the meeting, elite interviews do not guarantee accuracy of information or theoretical inferences—information taken from fieldwork in authoritarian contexts isn't necessarily reliable. There should be other ways to study authoritarian regime dynamics without limiting myself exclusively to elite interviews.

Additionally, as Tim keeps pointing out, one of the ideas I'm most interested in is the idea of authoritarian institutional balancing—my potential new term for the idea that regimes have to balance other actors within and without their country, and that they often do so in strategic ways to increase regime stability. I am extremely interested in INGOs as well, but I don't need to abandon my interest in authoritarian politics at the expense of INGOs. 

Instead, I believe that I can (and need to) study the bidirectional relationship between authoritarian regimes and INGOs from the perspective of both types of actors, instead of swinging my analytical pendulum from *just* the regime to *just* INGOs and back.

Because I have a dynamic model, I will need to create pseudo game theoretic utility functions for both actors. In the most basic terms, authoritarian regimes want power and stability and work to maintain that stability within institutional constraints on their power. They likely follow a careful calculus when they open themselves up to quasi-democratic institutions, using elections, parliaments, civil society, and other institutions as a sort of pawn to balance out other actors. 

Conversely, INGOs engage with foreign governments because of principled instrumental preferences [@MitchellSchmitz:2014]: they balance their own deeply held principle (e.g., enhancing human security, promoting human rights, etc.) with instrumental concerns (e.g., funding, political relations within the sector or with the regime, etc.). 

When regimes and INGOs willingly interact, they might do so when their preferences overlap: the regime allows INGOs to deliver some sort of service in an effort to help with institutional balancing, and INGOs provide those services because it fulfills their principled and instrumental organizational needs. There's an inevitable tradeoff in preferences though—regimes do not have full control over INGO activities and INGOs might not approve of the regime's behavior. 

## What to measure?

This leads to the second major issue we discussed in the committee meeting: in order to capture this tradeoff empirically, I need to clearly identify two dependent variables. First, to evaluate the shifting preferences of INGOs that work in and with authoritarian regimes, I plan on measuring the change in these organizations' programming and strategy. Through interviews, surveys, and archival research, I will measure how organizations adapt their programming in different regimes and (hopefully) determine how much of that adaptation is the direct result of authoritarian restrictions. A very simple example of this model might be something like:

> ∆ INGO programming ~ **restrictions on and oversight of INGOs** + principled and instrumental concerns [@MitchellSchmitz:2014; @Wong:2012] + links with other INGOs in policy sector [@Stroup:2012; @Carpenter:2014] + other things?

Second, I need to measure the openness of regimes to INGOs. As discussed in previous memos, there is no comprehensive data on de facto or de jure restrictions on INGO activity. However, because I am planning on doing in depth case work on just a few countries, I should be able to trace in detail both (1) the evolution of formal legal restrictions and (2) any instances of how those restrictions are used (or not), as reported in local and international media (i.e. track when governments shut down INGOs or arrest leaders or volunteers). I hypothesize that the propensity to restrict INGO activity is related to a number of factors, including the contentiousness of the issues the INGOs pursue, how closely those issues are aligned with regime preferences, and how those issues relate to other dynamics of domestic politics (e.g. giving human rights INGOs some limited latitude could placate or satisfy opposition demands for better international oversight of human rights). A simple example of this model is:

> **Restrictions on and oversight of INGOs** ~ issue contentiousness + alignment with regime preferences + interaction of issue with domestic politics + other things?

Restrictions on INGOs is present in both of these models, nesting the two functions together. INGOs set their programming according to their own endogenous preferences and the exogenous legal environment they operate in, while regimes set that legal environment based on the programming of the INGO and its relationship to domestic politics. Because these variables are nested, I should (in theory) be able to triangulate changes in INGO programming and strategy with shifts in domestic politics in authoritarian regimes. 

## Which issue areas?

To test these models and theories, I need to identify a set of international NGOs that (ideally) work in both the Middle East and China on similar issue areas, allowing me to see variation in their implementation of programming. The final problem we discussed at the committee meeting related to which issue area(s) I should look at to capture this variation. I had originally identified two issue areas—charitable faith-based humanitarian service and freedom of expression advocacy—that represented extremes in potential issue area contentiousness. During the meeting, we came to the conclusion that there's like not enough variation in these two sectors to yield any interesting results: we decided that regimes are probably more than happy to allow humanitarian service provision INGOs to operate in their countries and probably universally wary of doing the same for freedom of expression INGOs. Furthermore, faith-based INGOs might be too unique of a phenomenon and therefore any conclusions found in their study might not be generalizable, while the freedom of expression advocacy sector might be too homogenous and similarly constrained by authoritarian legal environments (see Figure 1).

![General regime preferences to policy issues](policy_issue_preferences.pdf)

In an effort to capture more variance in regime reaction and INGO programming, it was suggested that I look at a sector that falls more in the middle of the service provision–advocacy spectrum, such as education. Ideally, any issue area I choose needs to have (1) heterogeneity in the types of programs and services it provides (e.g. I can't look at a sector that only provides legal support for incarcerated bloggers), (2) heterogeneity in the level of contentiousness with the ruling regime (e.g. I can't look at a sector that is entirely antagonistic or subservient to legal restrictions), (3) theoretical leverage and generalizability (e.g. I can't look at a sector that is too niche, or that doesn't provide enough information to test my theories). 

Before throwing myself too deeply into 1–2 issue areas, I looked more closely at all three potential issues, in part because I am less interested in education INGOs than I am in the other two (though I definitely recognize the value in studying a sector that's more in the middle of the spectrum). I first checked to see if education is an actual middle ground issue area and what other scholars have already done with education INGOs. I then checked to see if faith-based and freedom of expression INGOs follow our initial assumptions in Figure 1, determining if these sectors are really that polarized and homogenous. I fortunately found workable(?) variation and heterogeneity in all three (see Figure 2), which I describe below.

### Education INGOs

Prior to our meeting, I was entirely unfamiliar with this sector, which unlike human rights or international development, is quite understudied. Despite its relative lack of attention in academia, education has become a crucial pillar of the UN's development program: Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) enshrines a universal right to education, and the second Millennium Development Goal (MDG) aims to achieve universal primary education worldwide. Developed states have led the Education for All (EFA) movement for decades, and tensions between national sovereignty and global oversight of education have been a useful case for studying issues of sovereignty in a globalized world [@Mundy:2010]. Prior to the 1990s, UNESCO, the World Bank, UNICEF, and other formal intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) led the EFA movement and framed education as an issue of international development, which opened doors to millions of dollars in funding from USAID, DFID, and other state-based aid agencies. 

Starting in the 1990s, however, in conjunction with the worldwide surge in transnational organizations, INGOs began to take the lead in EFA efforts, fueled by government grants and private donations [@Mundy:2010; @ButheMajorMello-e-Souza:2012]. For example, a coalition of INGOs led by Oxfam International, ActionAid, and Education International created the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), which pressures states to adhere to the UDHR and MDGs and advocate for "the millions of adults and children who are denied their right to education."^[See [http://www.campaignforeducation.org/en/about-us/about-education-for-all](http://www.campaignforeducation.org/en/about-us/about-education-for-all).] GCE partners with dozens of well known organizations, including CARE International, Save the Children, and Global March on Child Labor. 

Though it is generally categorized as a development issue (and should thus probably be less contentious than traditional human rights advocacy), education provision and advocacy has significant variation in contentiousness, both in the conflict between state sovereignty and global governance (e.g. leaders often don't want to outsource education provision to outsiders, even in the US), and in conflicting values—Chinese officials have been wary of US-based universities entering higher education^[For example, see "China says no room for 'western values' in university education," *The Guardian*, January 30, 2015, [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/china-says-no-room-for-western-values-in-university-education](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/china-says-no-room-for-western-values-in-university-education).], and actors in states like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria have often been vehemently opposed to Western education (see the Taliban and Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, the Taliban in Afghanistan, and Boko Haram in Nigeria). 

There is thus interesting and workable variation in the education INGO sector, ranging from organizations that strictly advocate for improved education (like the newly created Malala Fund) to organizations that provide on-the-ground educational services. 

### Freedom of expression INGOs (FEINGOS)

Prior to deeper research in this sector, I had planned on limiting myself almost exclusively to INGOs that almost exclusively advocated for freedom of expression rights, defending bloggers and journalists and shaming countries that violate rights of expression. I had also naively assumed that this was the primary purpose of the FEINGO sector, which is why we assumed stark homogeneity in potential regime responses to these organizations. Why would any autocrat who imprisons journalists willingly allow the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) to set up shop in their country? This sector is a lot more diverse than I had thought, however, and I still might be able to use it in my dissertation work.

Like the EFA movement, the freedom of expression movement is based on the UN's UDHR. Article 19 declares that "[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers." Since the UDHR, hundreds of INGOs have been formed to advocate for and provide enhanced services for this universal right. Some organizations, such as Article19 (the Amnesty International of the freedom of expression sector) Reporters Without Borders, CPJ, and the International Press Institute work with regimes to promote policy reforms related to media regulation, censorship, defamation, and intellectual property (among others) and create global indices of censorship and press freedom. Some of these organizations get involved in actual litigation, but others attempt to work with authoritarian regimes to propose and enact reforms. 

Some organizations also provide more tangible services. For example, International Media Support provides training to journalist unions, associations, and press councils and gives technical training on media business development to independent (and pseudo-independent) media outlets in authoritarian regimes in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. BBC Media Action, the BBC's formal charitable foundation, provides similar services by training local media organizations around the world in news production.

Authoritarian regimes have a history of strategically using foreign private actors to control and limit freedom of expression rights in their countries, despite the good intentions of actors in this issue area. For example, as a precondition to enter the huge Chinese market, Google, Microsoft, and Apple have all had to make freedom of expression concessions to the Chinese government, removing references to Tiananmen Square and other controversial topics—self-censorship that has angered many in the United States. Other private US- and UK-based firms sell IT security software to authoritarian regimes which are then used to surveil and censor activists and limit public consumption of information.

Beyond the world of private actors, Philip Bennett (of the Sanford School) and Moises Naim recently showed that authoritarian regimes have purposely turned to freedom of expression organizations to better control information. Despite the near-utopian optimistic view that the internet would allow activists and journalists to circumvent surveillance and overthrow dictatorships, governments have caught up and become more tech savvy: "Many [governments] went from spectators in the digital revolution to sophisticated early adopters of advanced technologies that allowed them to monitor content, activists, and journalists, and direct the flow of information" [@BennettNaim:2015]. Because direct censorship of the media and press is costly, authoritarian regimes have increasingly turned to a strategy of "stealth censorship," creating pseudo private firms and government-operated NGOs (GONGOs) that appear to be members of civil society that care about freedom of expression, but are really just government agencies. 

The fact that authoritarian regimes are beginning to use traditional institutions that enshrine freedom of expression—such as an independent press and the internet—to increase their own stability is exciting, as it provides variation in regime response to these INGOs. Despite their intentions of advocating for a free press and for expression rights, FEINGOs *are* entangled in domestic authoritarian politics and are not merely gadflies that regimes would like to ignore or restrict. Like the education INGO sector, I believe that there is workable variation among FEINGOs.

### Faith-based INGOS (FBINGOs)

As with the FEINGO sector, I had naively assumed that the faith-based INGO sector was limited to only international development issues, digging wells, delivering relief packages, and responding to natural disasters. As such, as a committee we assumed that there would be little variation in regime response to these organizations—what regime would turn down free service provision from ostensibly highly principled, cooperative, and subservient actors? What contention could possible exist?

After attending a couple ISA panels on religious INGOs, however, I learned that this assumption is incorrect. There *is* variation in contentiousness—not because of the services that are provided, but because of the religious nature of the organizations themselves. Middle Eastern regimes are far less likely to cooperate with Christian or Jewish FBINGOs, and China is less likely to cooperate with Christian, Islamic, and Jewish organizations because of the mismatch in regime and INGO preferences. FBINGOs often hope to proselytize (or least promote the image of their religious organizations) and regimes fear the potential social and religious conflict these preferences could disrupt and worsen. Allowing FBINGOs to operate can upset ethnic tensions: politically active Christian minorities in the Middle East and Muslim Uyghurs in northwestern China. In fact, FBINGOs that explicitly renounce notions of proselytizing are more successful and more active in authoritarian regimes,^[According to some as-yet-unpublished ISA papers.] and the UNHCR provides clear guidance about proselytizing and cooperation for FBINGOs dealing with refugee issues [@UNHCR:2014]. Though these organizations provide free relief services, regimes *do* reject the help. Catholic Relief Services, for example, is not currently allowed to help with refugees in Syria and instead operates along the border in Turkey and Lebanon, arguably because of their connection to the Vatican. Similarly, LDS Humanitarian Services was not allowed in Egypt for several years because of conflict between Mubarak and the Coptic Christian minority.

### Summary of issue areas

The table below provides a brief overview of these three issue areas and the variation in their contentiousness with the regimes they work with.

## How to choose?

As I have just described, I feel that all three issue areas have workable variation and could be useful in exploring the bidirectional relationship between INGOs and regimes, providing insight into INGO decisions to engage with a government and a regime's decision to use external actors as pawns for stability.

I have a few options for selecting which issues to explore, each with advantages and disadvantages:

### All three

@Carpenter:2014 looks at three issues that have failed to emerge onto the global advocacy agenda: wartime reparation payments, restrictions on autonomous weapons, and prohibitions against male circumcision. Though her narrative and theory sometimes gets lost in the weeds, the three cases do help build her argument that key gatekeepers control the advocacy agenda. Exploring education, freedom of expression, and faith-based INGOs would be ambitious (perhaps better for a book), but would provide comprehensive empirical coverage of the full range of regime contentiousness in the Middle East and China. 

### Just two

Looking at two of the issue areas might be the ideal approach. According to @SeawrightGerring:2008, selecting a single typical case (or two most-similar cases) does not always yield useful causal inferences, since often those cases are already at the population average and do not reveal new insights into the underlying theory. Instead, they recommend looking at extreme cases, or results where both the outcomes differ dramatically and are far from the mean. Following this advice, I should select issue areas that are on the extremes of the service–advocacy spectrum, like FBINGOs and FEINGOs, or education INGOs and FEINGOs.  

Though my initial inclination was to look at FB- and FEINGOs, I am now leaning toward looking at education and FEINGOs. As Tim said during our meeting, faith-based organizations might just be too weird and unique to be compared with other issue areas (though I still plan on studying them in the future). 

Education and freedom of expression INGOs are similar on a number of dimensions: both issues are enshrined in the UDHR and thus theoretically have global support from IGOs and UN-member countries, and both provide services that can be directly detrimental to the regime (Western indoctrination of schoolchildren and expanding access to information). Religious organizations provide more limited services, generally in response to disasters, famines, or wars. Additionally, though there is contention with regimes because of domestic ethnic and religious tensions, this form of contention is fundamentally different from education and freedom of expression, since relief services generally do not have the potential to change norms and attitudes toward the government. 

That is, education and freedom of expression INGOs ostensibly try to shape how a regime *teaches* and *provides information* to its population, whereas FBINGOs directly provide services.

### Just one

There is value in just choosing one sector, too. @Kelley:2012 does this masterfully by looking deeply at election monitoring INGOs, and her ongoing human trafficking work follows the same pattern. If I had to choose only choose one issue area, I'm more partial to FEINGOs—though they fall along the more contentious side of typical regime preferences and won't provide as much theoretical leverage.


# What I'm planning on doing next

* Meet with all three of you the week of March 2.
* Ensure that this approach—measuring INGO legal restrictions and changes in the programming of education and freedom of expression INGOs in China and the Middle East—is feasible and theoretically valid and workable.
* Set a date for the prospectus defense.
* Identify a 4th member of the committee, such as Ken Rogerson(?) or Phillip Bennett(?), who work on censorship and civil society and authoritarianism (both are professors of the practice, but Ken is officially on the graduate faculty and Phil could be added if needed).
* Start writing a formal prospectus, incorporating all the research design stuff I've developed in these memos.
* Conduct informal interviews with INGO leaders to see how I could potentially operationalize changes in programming.
* Start looking for (1) formal legislation for INGOs and (2) instances where INGOs are reported negatively in the media because of legal violations, in both China and the Middle East.
* Start mapping out the education INGO and FEINGO sectors with IssueCrawler.^[[https://www.issuecrawler.net](https://www.issuecrawler.net)]
