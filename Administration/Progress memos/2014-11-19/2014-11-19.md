For the sake of transparency, to boost my productivity, and to give me a strong commitment device, I'm going to send each of you a memo detailing my research progress *every three weeks*. These informal memos will typically have four sections detailing (1) what I've done and (2) what I've learned since the previous memo, (3) how my overall theory has evolved based on those new findings, and (4) what I'm planning to do in the next three weeks.

# What I've done

Since the previous data landscape memo, I've been quite busy gathering and playing with potential data sources. Here's a semi-comprehensive summary:

* **Yearbook of International Organizations**: I worked with the support team of the YIO to see if it was possible to download a full list of organization information for organizations classified as B, F, G, or N (different forms of INGOs). It's not possible to do it in bulk, so I'll need to download or copy/paste the organization names and details 20 at a time (or write a script to scrape them; unfortunately their website is not amenable to easy scraping, though).
* **Arab Institute for Human Rights**: Although their site was down for several weeks, I was able to scrape AIHR's website and download detailed information for all the organizations listed in their database. This is a potential goldmine of data with information on 762 organizations. I've included other summary information about the dataset at the end of this memo.
* **China Development Brief**: CDB's website was also down for several weeks, but it is now back up. They have detailed information for ≈250 organizations in China, but they are more commercially minded than AIHR. They offer a $50 PDF version of the information on their website. Because of this, I haven't yet scraped and downloaded their information (in case it's a violation of their intellectual property). Perhaps the best middle-of-the-road approach is to buy the PDF *and* scrape.
* **International Center for Not-for-Profit Law**: The ICNL has detailed reports of domestic and international NGO legal restrictions in 48 countries that they regularly update. This could be another potential goldmine, especially if I can get past versions of their reports—I could potentially create a panel dataset of country-year data. Their reports could also be excellent inputs for a machine learning algorithm that attempts to quantitatively measure and rank NGO restrictions.
* **Event data**: I have been working with a few of the PhD students associated with the Open Event Data Alliance to get their event data coding system working on my own corpora of data. I'm *this* close to getting it all working, and the results should hopefully be useful. Once I get it working, I should be able to feed in any corpus of text.
* **Machine learning**: I have spent a lot of time studying and learning about machine learning algorithms for classifying text, since one of my possible strategies is to create an index of INGO restrictions based on a corpus of text. I completed a mini course on Coursera taught by a couple professors at Stanford, and I'm finishing another mini course on Udacity specifically on classifying text. The example project in the class uses the full archive of Enron e-mails in the years prior to their implosion to create a model to measure fraud, so the concepts are directly applicable to my goal of measuring restrictivity. I am also meeting with Shahryar Minhas (a PhD student in political science who is working on a computational text algorithm to predict regime type—he's also one of Tim's students) on November 20 to talk more about machine learning and text analysis.
* **Mini proposals**: I sent you all three possible preliminary trajectories for research yesterday.


# What I've learned

* I haven't learned anything too theoretical or academic, since I've just been playing around with data and have been doing lots of coding and scripting. I plan on doing more reading and theoretical work in the next few weeks.
* There really isn't a lot of good quantitative data out there on NGO or INGO activity or on policies and legislation restricting civil society. There's a definite gap to be filled.
* Text analysis is hard, but if done right, it can provide excellent insight into things that have been difficult (or costly) to measure. 

# How the project has evolved

This section is essentially the three mini proposals I sent yesterday. In future memos I will use that as the baseline for explaining the project's evolution.

# What I'm planning on doing next

Here's what I'll do in the next three weeks:

* Identify a 4th (and 5th?) committee member.
* Present my preliminary proposals during Tim's grad student group in early December.
* Scrape country reports from ICNL's website and phone them to ask about historical reports.
* Collect data from the China Development Brief.
* Read new book by Jessica Teets, *Civil Society under Authoritarianism: The China Model* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014), which looks like it covers topics very similar to mine.
* Consider possible countries and organizations to use as cases.
