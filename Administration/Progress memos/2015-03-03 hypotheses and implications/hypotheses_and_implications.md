# My questions

1. How are INGO strategies and structure influenced by the domestic politics of the countries they target? (*addresses political science, IR, and nonprofit management literatures on internal dynamics and behavior of international nongovernmental institutions*)
2. How do authoritarian regimes use foreign institutions as "pawns" to enhance their stability? (*addresses political science and IR literatures on authoritarian survival and the role of non-state actors in domestic politics*)


# My propositions and observable implications

1. INGOs change their programming and behavior in response to the legal environment for advocacy and service provision in authoritarian regimes. Organizations weigh these changes and shifts against their stated principles (i.e. their missions) and instrumental concerns (i.e. their budgets).
	* INGOs that adhere strictly to their normative missions will be less likely to make strategic adjustments that conflict with their principles.
	* INGOs will respond differently to different types of legal restrictions (i.e. staffing requirements, limitations on funds, prohibitions on activities, arrests, etc.).
	* INGOs that deal more with advocacy may reframe their activities as a form of service provision to avoid restrictions.
2. Authoritarian regimes adjust the legal environment for foreign-sponsored advocacy and service provision based on (1) how the issue is aligned with the regime's preferences and (2) how the issue affects domestic politics (i.e., if foreign involvement in a policy sector changes the balance of political power within the regime, or has the potential to enflame ethnic or cultural tensions, or has the potential to mitigate domestic or international criticism of the regime, etc.).
	* Regimes that benefit from INGO services will be more open to their activities (i.e. technical training or assistance with social policy formation or humanitarian assistance will be looked on favorably).
	* INGOs that are composed of members (or based in countries) that are culturally aligned with contentious groups in regimes will face stricter restrictions (i.e. Christians in the Middle East, Muslims in China).
	* De facto restrictions on advocacy INGOs will be stricter and more common than restrictions on service provision INGOs.


# Why should we care?

These findings will:

1. help INGOs operate more effectively in authoritarian contexts by (1) predicting the incidence of restricted legal environments and (2) showing how other organizations have balanced principled and instrumental concerns in those environments,
2. open the black box of authoritarian institutional balancing, revealing more about how dictators carefully control other actors to remain in power, and
3. deepen our understanding of the effects of international institutions on domestic politics.
