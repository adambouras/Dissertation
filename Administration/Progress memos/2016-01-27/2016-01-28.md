I look forward to meeting with most of you tomorrow. In preparation for the meeting, here's a brief progress update.

# What I have done in the past month

I've made substantial progress on each of my four empirical chapters, and I should start my qualitative data collection and fieldwork soon. 

## H~1~ : Authoritarian stability and INGO regulations (macro-level statistical analysis, mostly)

> **H~1~**: When authoritarian regimes perceive themselves to be more stable, the *de jure* regulatory environment for INGOs will be less restrictive.

As I've slogged through tracking down all the legislation and regulations I can possibly find,^[Including from the [International Center for Nonprofit Law](http://www.icnl.org/), [legislationonline.org](http://www.legislationline.org/), and [global-regulation.com](http://www.global-regulation.com/), among other useful sites.] I've run into an issue with coding the seriousness and restrictiveness of each regulation. For example, in Egypt, international NGOs are regulated by an ensemble of at least ten different laws (see [@tbl:egypt_laws]), some more than 100 years old. While Law 84 of 2002 is perhaps the most prominent component of the current INGO regulatory environment, each of the regulations in the table have been used against foreign NGOs during the past decade. My original goal was to categorize or rate each law along some sort of 3-, 5-, or 10-point scale, which I could then use in regression models. However, given the capriciousness of the application of these laws, I've found this to be nearly impossible. 

!INCLUDE "tables_figures/egypt_legislation.md"

A related issue that I've run into is that there is rarely (if ever) legislation aimed *primarily* and *exclusively* at international NGOs (with the notable exceptions of Russia's 2012 and 2015 anti-NGO laws, which were created specifically to shutter US-based organizations). Laws governing civil society cover issues with both domestic and international organizations, and most often, regulations that are applied to INGOs are the same as those applied to domestic NGOs. 

Because of these hurdles, I've paused my attempts at coding the legal severity of laws and have instead tried to look at the overall regulatory environment for civil society—both domestic and international. At the annual ISA conference last year, I presented a first attempt at explaining the determinants of civil society restrictions in authoritarian regimes, but I was extremely limited by available data. I used a variable from the CIRI human rights dataset^[See [humanrightsdata.com](http://www.humanrightsdata.com/).] that codes a country's freedom of association as an ordinal variable with three levels: unrestricted, limited, and severely restricted. I then tried to predict restrictions with a set of independent variables related to regime stability. Ultimately, the measure of freedom of association was too broadly defined and slow-moving to produce any useful results, so I temporarily gave up.

However, earlier this month, the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Project, jointly produced by Notre Dame and the University of Gothenburg, released its first complete public dataset.^[See [v-dem.net](https://www.v-dem.net/en/).] The project provides hundreds of democracy-related indicators based on a combination of existing published data, expert opinion, and a sophisticated Bayesian measurement model. Most importantly, it contains a dozen variables related to the regulatory legal environment for civil society, including measures of entry and exit regulations, repression, participatory environment, and the level of women's participation. 

Each of these variables is measured both as an ordinal variable and as continuous point estimates from the project's measurement model, and as such, each has more variation than the single, overly broad CIRI variable I had been using. I've been toying with this new data to see if it will help with the statistical analysis for my first hypothesis, and it looks somewhat promising so far. [@fig:vdem_summary] provides a summary of civil society repression in China, Egypt, and Russia, and [@fig:vdem_model] shows the preliminary results of two Bayesian regression models, highlighting the positive effect of regime stability (as measured by the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG)) on civil society repression—as regime stability improves, the environment for repression improves too.^[The model reports changes in units of measurement model point estimates, so the actual effects are currently uninterpretable. I need to figure out a way to show the substantive impact of stability on repression.] 

![Continuous and ordinal measures of civil society repression in China, Egypt, and Russia](tables_figures/fig_both.pdf){#fig:vdem_summary}

![Coefficients from Bayesian linear regression models](tables_figures/fig_model.pdf){#fig:vdem_model}

Based on this first cut, I'm planning on working more closely with the dataset to get better, more interpretable measures of the legal environment (perhaps combining repression with entry and exit regulations). I'm working with two political science PhD students to use event data to generate measures of regional instability and international shaming, which are important drivers of NGO restrictions in the qualitative evidence I've looked at so far. I'm also planning on somehow using the data I've collected on legislation. Even if I can't figure out a way to consistently code the severity of each law, I can use the years of legislation to build a survival model (which is the approach taken by @DupuyRonPrakash:2012 and @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a). 

My biggest concern with all this data analysis, though, is that even if it does capture civil society repression and regulations, it doesn't necessarily reflect the regulatory environment for *international* NGOs. However, as I noted earlier, there is no clear way to disentangle the domestic and international applications of these laws. To get at the international aspect of the regulatory environment, I plan on looking carefully at the laws of my two main case countries (Egypt and China) and determining which aspects of civil society laws are used on international NGOs.


## H~2~: Authoritarian regime preferences for INGOs (micro-level case studies)

> **H~2~**: When the issue area an INGO works with is more aligned with the preferences and needs of a regime, the *de facto* implementation of the regulatory environment for INGOs will be less restrictive.

In my second empirical chapter, I'm planning on continuing my qualitative case study work and looking at the *application* of INGO legislation in both China and Egypt (whereas in the first empirical chapter, I look at the determinants of the creation of these laws). 

At Judith's behest, I took a break from analyzing my main cases to tackle Russia as a third supplementary case. There are at least two good reasons for this: (1) even though Russia is not one of my main cases, its treatment of INGOs has been reported prominently since at least 2012 and people ask me about Russia almost every time I talk about my dissertation work (so I should probably know something about it), and (2) it provides a good initial test case of my hypotheses, since I can qualitatively track both the internal and external threats to regime stability and the contraction of the regulatory environment for INGOs. 

![Russian government stability and restrictions on INGOs](tables_figures/russia.pdf){#fig:russia}

I'm still finishing the write-up for this case—I had intended on finishing it before our meeting tomorrow, but life unfortunately got busy. As I preview, I offer [@fig:russia], which overlays key INGO-related legislation with Russian regime stability, presidents, and wars since 1995. At first glance, the Foreign Agent Law of 2012 and the Undesirable Organizations Law of 2015 (both targeted specifically at US-based INGOs) are timed with drops in internal regime stability. The 2006 NGO law (Federal Law 18-FZ) was quite restrictive as well, but *internal* stability was consistently strong throughout that era. The main impetus for the 2006 law appears to be the Color Revolutions in Ukraine, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan—Putin worried about the destabilizing influence of democracy promotion INGOs and imposed harsh restrictions to counter their operations. I will provide more detailed and in-depth analysis soon—never fear.


## H~3~ and H~4~: Global INGO survey (macro-level survey analysis)

> **H~3~**: An INGO with ideal preferences that fall outside the allowable regulatory environment will face pressure to temper its programming  and become more compliant to regime demands.

> **H~4~**: When an INGO has more operational flexibility in its provision of services or advocacy, the organization's overlap with regime preferences will increase and the INGO will face fewer restrictions.

While my first two empirical chapters look at the government–INGO relationship from the perspective of the government (i.e. why governments create their INGO regulations), my last two look at how INGOs respond to the regulatory environment.

The first of the INGO chapters takes a macro-level approach with a global survey of INGOs. Initially I had planned on surveying only organizations working on education and freedom of expression issues, but once again,^[This is becoming a common theme for this dissertation…] I ran into a serious issue: NGO surveys tend have notoriously low response rates (between 2–5%).^[Judith's recent human trafficking NGO survey had a response rate of more than 40%, which is miraculous and exceptional and I doubt I'll be able to replicate that.] Over the summer, I collected a list of 2,696 freedom of expression INGOs and 6,635 education INGOs from the Yearbook of International Organizations. Roughly half of these organizations have contact information available or are still in existence, and a sizable proportion of them aren't necessarily *that* related to either issue. For example, the International Association of Philatelic Journalists is considered a freedom of expression organization (hooray for unbiased reporting on stamps, I guess), and the Manufacturers of Educational and Commercial Stationery European Association is listed as an education organization. After accounting for all these irrelevant organizations, my universe of actual organizations is actually quite small, and given the expected low response rate, I will likely have very few responses (perhaps a few dozen).

In consultation with Judith, I've decided to expand the scope of the survey. Rather than look at just two issue areas, I'm planning on surveying as many INGOs as possible. I have a list of 15,000 INGOs from the Directory of Development Organizations^[See [devdir.org](http://www.devdir.org/).] that has already been used in survey experiments by researchers at Brigham Young University, and I have a list of around 1,000 human trafficking NGOs from Judith's research. If I get a response rate of 5%, I'll still have over 1,000 actual responses to the survey, which is far better than the couple dozen I had been expecting. Though the responses won't be limited to just education and freedom of expression organizations, this wider net of NGOs will provide me with a broader perspective on INGO restrictions and organizational strategies for coping with legal regulations.

Over the past month I've been finalizing the survey itself. Currently it contains sections probing the respondent organization's general background, its relationship with its host government, its awareness of the legal environment, and its strategies for complying with regulations. I've also tentatively included a hypothetical vignette along these lines:

> Your organization just received substantial funding from a prominent donor to open an office in a country that {recently democratized after the president of 30 years stepped down | is run by a life-long dictator}. The country {has few restrictions on advocacy by foreign organizations | has strict regulations regarding international NGOs}. 

The vignette is followed by a series of questions about what the organization would consider before opening an office. 

Once I've finalized the questions, I'm planning on consulting with post-docs at SSRI (whose job it is to consult on surveys) and working with Tim to streamline and proofread the questions and ensure that the survey is methodologically sound. Then I'll spam the INGO world.


## H~3~ and H~4~: Specific INGO case studies (micro-level case studies)

My second INGO chapter looks at a subset of INGOs at a micro level. As I discussed and justified in my previous update memo, I'm planning on interviewing staff and leadership at the organizations listed in [@tbl:fieldwork].

Table: Case study organizations {#tbl:fieldwork}

Here's what I'm doing in preparation for my fieldwork:

- I'm adapting my survey questions as a semi-structured interview protocol.
- I'm working with Sanford's Ann Skinner to apply for an IRB exemption for both my interviews and my survey, since I generally meet the qualifications for exemption (i.e. my research involves "the use of … survey procedures, interview procedures, observation of public behavior.").
- I'm working with Duke Kunshan University to get a sponsorship letter so I can get an academic travel visa to China.
- I will start to contact organizations in mid-February.

In parallel with my tangential case study on Russia, I'm working on a tangential case study on INGOs that work in (or out of) Russia. The most prominent and active INGO affected by Russia's ongoing crackdown on foreign organizations (and Putin's perennial bugaboo) has been George Soros's Open Society Foundations, which pursues its programming from abroad by funding domestic Russian NGOs. OSF does not work with education issues, but it does advocate for freedom of expression as part of democracy promotion efforts, and as such, fits well in the scope of my two main issue areas. Sanford's Bob Conrad works for George Soros and has several close contacts in OSF, including two former country directors for Russia. We met last week and he is currently connecting me with his OSF colleagues—if all goes well, I should be able to schedule a couple 30–45 minute interviews with key OSF staff in the coming weeks. I am also going to contact the Carnegie Moscow Center, a democracy promotion INGO that has managed to stay in Russia in spite of the ongoing crackdown. Comparing OSF and the Carnegie Center will provide a useful contrast of organizational strategies to regulations.


# Specific questions and issues I need help with

- *Statistics*: Looking at the general NGO regulatory environment statistically and disentangling the international component of those regulations through case studies appears to be the best strategy for measuring the macro-level factors influencing INGO legislation. Is this approach okay and methodologically sound?
- *Survey*: Expanding the pool of potential INGOs will yield more responses, but does it go too far afield from my original research goals? 
- *Survey questions*: My questions are currently structured around specific pieces of information I want to know about the organizations, but the theory behind those questions is relatively loosey-goosey (i.e. not rooted in any specific literature). I need to change this and base the questions in better, clearer theory, I think.
- *Survey questions*: I adapted many of my survey questions from Tim's research on global business regulations [-@Buthe:2011]. I would love to get his input and feedback once I've finalized the questions.
- *Semi-structured interview protocol*: I've never made one of these and would love to see some examples of them.
