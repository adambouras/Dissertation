# 1. Research Design 

## Purpose of the study

International nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) play a critical role in global governance and international politics as they promote human rights, provide aid and relief, and improve poverty and development. However, INGOs are influenced by the cultural, legal, and political environments of the countries they work in, and as a result, organizations working in autocracies can inadvertently support repressive regimes. Using a novel dataset of INGO regulations and detailed case studies of education and freedom of expression INGOs working in Egypt, China, and Russia, my research seeks to explain why and how autocrats regulate INGOs and how INGOs respond to those regulations. This research will provide practical policy guidance both for INGOs working under repressive regulations and for the international bodies and agencies that rely on these organizations to assist with global governance. Through my research, I plan to (1) determine which factors lead authoritarian regimes to create and implement their regulatory environments for INGOs and (2) explain and predict how INGOs respond to those regulations and restrictions. 

## Participant activities

My research on authoritarian regimes and legal restrictions uses publicly accessible country-level data from existing data sources and does not involve human subjects. My research on INGO responses to those restrictions, on the other hand, involves human subjects in two ways: (1) a macro-level global survey of all international NGOs and (2) micro-level key informant interviews and analysis of selected organizations. 

### Global survey of international NGOs

First, to understand how INGOs relate to the governments of their host countries in general, I will conduct an online global survey of INGOs that work in any authoritarian regimes. Using a database of nearly 40,000 organizations culled from dozens of publicly accessible online NGO directories, I ask a series of questions designed to identify aspects of an INGO's organizational culture that influence its response to the institutional environment of its host country. In general, I ask respondents to (1) define their organization's core mission, vision, and values, and discuss how their programming reflects those principles, (2) explain the organization's flexibility (i.e. how it raises funds, how it collaborates with other organizations, etc.), and (3) describe and discuss their relationships with the governments of their target countries. I use the results from the survey to test each of my theory's mechanisms and determine how, why, and when INGOs shift their core values, become more flexible and instrumental, or attempt to induce the government to change its preferences.

Study participants will be invited to respond to an online survey hosted on Qualtrics that should take roughly 10–15 minutes to complete. A draft of the survey is included in the appendix.


### Organizational analysis and key informant interviews of select education and freedom of expression INGOs

Second, to get a more micro-level view of how INGOs respond to the institutional environments of their host countries, I will conduct key informant interviews of employees and activists in a dozen INGOs. I limit these interviews to INGOs that deal with education and freedom of expression issues in Egypt and China. Both countries are highly salient cases, given the rapid growth of civil society in China and China's prominent position in the global economy, and due to tumultuous post-revolutionary politics in Egypt. The two policy issue areas provide theoretical leverage for my argument. Both issues are enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights and theoretically have global support from UN-member countries (including most authoritarian nations). Each issue can also be classified as service provision (education) and advocacy (freedom of expression). Regimes can be expected to prefer one issue (education) over the other (freedom of expression) since education poses less of a threat to a regime's politics stability. However, however, both issues can still threaten regimes—education and freedom of expression INGOs ostensibly try to shape how a regime *teaches* and *provides information* to its population and can thus potential weaken government control. 

I have identified a dozen INGOs and research centers to investigate and use as case studies. My fieldwork will take me to two international locations: London and Beijing. London is a central hub for many of the world's largest and most influential international NGOs, including the main freedom of expression and education INGOs I plan to study. Because there are stricter regulations on INGOs in China, and thus fewer INGOs to interview, I plan on interviewing a smaller number of organizations and research centers in Beijing. 

I intend on researching and studying the following organizations:

- **United Kingdom**: Article 19, Index on Censorship, Media Legal Defence Initiative, Internews, Oxfam, Save the Children, CARE International
- **China**: INCLUDED, China Care International, Oxfam Hong Kong, SIL East Asia, Chinese Ministry of Education, NGO Research Center at Tsinghua University
- **Other foreign countries** (*fieldwork will be done via Skype, phone, and e-mail*): International Media Support (Copenhagen); Reporters Without Borders (Paris); Global Campaign for Education (Johannesburg); Education International (Brussels); Injaz al-Arab (Amman)
- **United States** (* fieldwork will be done via Skype, phone, and e-mail*): Internews (Washington, DC); Committee to Protect Journalists (New York); World Education (Boston)

I will schedule and conduct 20–30 minute interviews in person, over the phone, or via Skype using the survey instrument to structure the conversation.  The survey instrument and interview protocol are generally equivalent—while the survey encourages short open-ended responses, I will be able to probe interviewees for more detailed answers.


## Data security

I will not collect personally identifiable data when conducting the survey—no survey question asks about the name or position of the respondent. I do collect personally identifiable data about the people I interview (as I talk with them directly), but I store my interview notes and list of INGO contacts in two separate data tables, linked with a shared primary key column. Unless given explicit permission by an interviewee, I will not identify any person by name when reporting the interview results. I will store all survey and interview data in an encrypted disk image on my computer, which also uses full-disk encryption. When possible, I plan on using PGP to encrypt any online communication with INGO staff and activists who also have those capabilities.


# 2.  Subject selection and recruitment

## Survey

I have collected a large database of more than 40,000 organization e-mail addresses from dozens of online, publicly accessible NGO directories, including the Yearbook of International Organizations, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs's Integrated Civil Society Organizations System, the Directory of Development Organizations, the Arab Institute of Human Rights directory, and the Polaris Project.

I will send each organization two invitations to complete the survey, spaced a week apart. Because the list does not distinguish between domestic and international NGOs, I filter domestic organizations out using the survey—if a respondent indicates they work primarily in the country they are based in, the survey ends early. I will use an e-mail invitation similar to this:

> Hello,
>  
> I'm a doctoral student at Duke University in the United States and I am conducting a research project about international NGOs and the laws and regulations of the countries they work in. I'm hoping that you might be willing to help me out by sharing some insights about {ORG\_NAME}'s experiences in working with foreign governments. 
> 
> I have created a short 10-minute survey. If you have time to take it, it would be incredibly helpful. I'll share a summary of the survey results with you if you are interested. The survey allows your organization to remain anonymous if you prefer. I would be so grateful if you could complete the survey by **{DEADLINE}**.
> 
> If you don't like taking surveys, or if you would rather speak via phone or Skype, I would love to talk with you to learn more about your organization's experiences. Reply to this e-mail and we can schedule a one-on-one conversation if you have time.
>

## Interviews

As described previously, I have selected a collection of INGOs that work on either education or freedom of expression issues in Egypt and/or China. I will contact several members of each organization via e-mail and phone—in particular managers and area or issue specialists—and schedule in-person meetings or remote interviews. I will use an e-mail invitation similar to this, but adapted to each organization:

> Dear {PERSON\_NAME},
> 
> I'm Andrew Heiss, a PhD candidate at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University in the United States. In my dissertation research, I am studying how authoritarian regimes restrict and regulate international NGOs and how INGOs adapt their strategies and programming in response to those regulations. 
> 
> I'm hoping to use {ORG\_NAME} as one of the case studies for my research, since it has {*explanation for choosing their organization*}
> 
> Through my research, I'm hoping to discover what organizational factors determine when an INGO will fight against, mitigate, or give in to government regulations. That is, what is it about {ORG\_NAME} that {*organization's experience in the country*}? 
> 
> If you are willing, I'd be delighted to ask you a few questions in a 30-minute phone or Skype call {or in-person visit if I'm traveling to their location} regarding your experience with {ORG\_NAME} in {COUNTRY\_NAME}; {ORG\_NAME}'s relationship with the {COUNTRY\_NAME} government; {ORG\_NAME}'s core mission, vision, and values; and other questions to get a better understanding of {ORG\_NAME}'s organizational culture and its role in shaping its response to {COUNTRY\_NAME} INGO regulations.
