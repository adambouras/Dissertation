# Main theoretic questions

* Autocratic institutions
	* How can we best explain the emergence and persistence of semi-democratic institutions in hybrid regimes?
	* How do seemingly democratic institutions (elections, parliaments, bureaucratic insulation, civil society) operate under authoritarian and hybrid regimes (with emphasis on the Middle East)?
* Non-state and non-governmental actors
	* How do non-state actors and global civil society influence policy reforms?
	* How do third sector advocacy organizations influence policy reforms?
	* Is the idea of global civil society inextricably linked to norms of democracy?


# More specific theoretic questions

* Can INGOs play a role on the international stage on their own, or are they dependent on IGOs as gatekeepers?
* Why do autocrats allow local NGOs to exist and operate? Do these organizations actually wield power? What determines that power?
* Why do autocrats allow international NGOs to exist and operate? Do these organizations actually wield power? What determines that power?
* How do foreign INGOs operate in authoritarian regimes? What changes (if any) do they make to be more palatable to the host country?
* How does foreign funding and support affect the effectiveness of INGOs operating in authoritarian regimes?


# Main policy questions

* What are the determinants of INGO political power in authoritarian regimes?
* Can global civil society improve governance in autocracies? Should it?
* Are there policies or strategies than can improve and enhance (I)NGO activities in autocracies without falling afoul of the autocrats?
