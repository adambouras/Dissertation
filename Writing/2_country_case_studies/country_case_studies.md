TODO: Connect this with the amicable contempt model, show the figure with just regime preferences


While the statistical models in the previous chapter provide some observational evidence for the internal, external, and reputational determinants of authoritarian restrictions on global civil society, there are limits in what the statistics can reveal. 


In this chapter, I analyze how the mechanisms of internal risk, external threats, and international reputation influence the development of specific laws governing international civil society, or the regime's ideal point in the model of amicable contempt (see @fig:theory-regime-dot). Based on the model


—Egypt, Russia, and China—and discover additional nuance within and evidence for each hypothesized mechanism.

Frame this as a story of concessions - to maintain balance (since this is modeled as a negotiation), dictators have to constrict or expand the allowable space for CS - they constrict under certain circumstances, when they need to, and expand + make concessions when they need to

# Egypt

![Timeline of de jure and de facto NGO regulations in Egypt](../../Output/figures/2-timeline-egy){#fig:timeline-egy}

On January 25, 2011, the Arab Spring popular uprising shook Egypt as millions took to the streets, chanting "*Ash-shaʿb yurīd isqāṭ an-niẓām!*"[^1]—"The people want the fall of the regime!" Protestors demanding the resignation of then-president Hosni Mubarak and called for political reform and democratization once he stepped down after 18 days of protests.

In the months immediately following the revolution, there appeared to be a renaissance of civic space. Citizen ligans, bloggers running for parliament. International NGOs that had previously been kicked out, like IRI, were invited back in, and other prominent human rights INGOs came, like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch. 

the revolution Civic space initially appeared open 

But noooope


The case of Egypt shows the importance of internal regime cohesion and consolidation, as well as external threats. Reputation plays a small role, but that's all.


## Overview of legal environment for international NGOs


ICNL stuff

Law 32 of 1964 - gave the state the ability to control NGOs and their activities - set the initial level of government preferences; future laws based on this ideal point
Law 84 of 2002 - revised and updated version of Law 153 of 1999, which was struck down as unconstitutional in 2000
Law 70 of 2017 - draft law finally made official

A persistent thread running through the development of Egypt's NGO regulatory environment is that of control—each law dealing with civil society was designed to provide maximum political benefit to the ruling party by delineating the allowable space for NGO action. 

## Domestic unrest and regime cohesion

According to the results of the statistical model, regimes with greater internal cohesion and longer tenure are more likely to restrict the civil society regulatory environment. One possible explanation for this unexpected prediction is that though civil society is one of many institutions dictators need to deal with, it is less important than other actors that pose more of an immediate threat. As regimes gain more power and stability, they see less of a need to leave civil society unregulated, and domestic political crises in older, consolidated regimes can lead to formal legislation that restricts civil society. The experience of Egypt offers a prime example of this dynamic.

### Civil society and internal threats to stability under Nasser

Egypt's first foray into regulating civil society in 1964 came after years of political consolidation. After coming to power in the Free Officers revolution in 1952, president Gamal Abdel Nasser spent the first decade of his rule balancing the most dangerous institutional challengers to his regime. In 1952, Nasser undertook massive land reforms that redistributed land to the landless and increase the country's agricultural production. More importantly for the internal politics of his regime, though, the land reforms were designed "to break any political opposition to the revolution from the *ancien régime*'s *pasha* class" [@Bush:2002, 9]. The reforms granted the state the authority to seize land from the former political ruling class and were thus instrumental in balancing out the risk they posed to Nasser's rule. In addition to neutralizing the economic ruling class, Nasser limited opposition from political and religious elites by banning all political parties in 1953 and suppressing the Muslim Brotherhood in 1954, blacklisting former politicians and arresting tens of thousands of Islamists [@Jankowski:2002, 20–23]. These swift and dramatic moves against potential institutional challengers allowed Nasser to consolidate his party's rule and remain in power for nearly two decades.

Having coopted and neutralized key political actors, Nasser turned to other institutional actors that posed less of an immediate threat. In 1964, after more than a decade in office, Nasser helped pass the Law 32 of 1964, or the Civic Association Code—the first piece of legislation related to NGOs in the Middle East. This new law followed Nasser's pattern of subsuming political institutions into the government. NGOs required government approval to be established, and officials were given unlimited discretion and authority to grant or deny registration status. Additionally, officials could dissolve or merge registered NGOs and could replace their boards of directors [@icnl-egypt:2010, 2–3; @Agati:2007]. 

Law 32 of 1964 established a pattern for all future NGO regulations in Egypt. The law gave the government incredible control over Egypt's nascent civil society, but it was rarely followed to the letter. Law 32 served as a marker of the regime's ideal level of NGO activity—the ideal point in the model of amicable contempt—but the regime used discretion to expand or constrict the allowable space around that ideal point. Accordingly, Egyptian civil society organizations found ways to work within that allowable space and adapted to the new regulations. In the early 1980s, NGOs dealing with contentious issues like human rights and women's empowerment avoided the jurisdiction of Law 32 by registering as "civil societies," which were government by the country's civil code, rather than associations, which fell under the purview of the Ministry of Social Affairs [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 105]. Some NGOs were thus able to take advantage of the law's discretion and selected their own regulatory body (though, as I explore in more detail in Chapter 6, such a strategy is only possible when NGOs enjoy large levels of instrumental flexibility). 

Motivated primarily by concerns of domestic stability and internal regime cohesion, the Egyptian government therefore formalized loopholes and discretionary authority into the law—the regime allowed for a degree of institutional dissonance from NGOs and civil society, but reserved the right to step in and stop unwanted activities at its discretion. 

### Civil society and internal threats to stability under Mubarak

Under Nasser, civil society entered into the regime's stability-seeking calculus only after more salient actors had been balanced and controlled. Regulating civil society was put off until the regime had consolidated power. This pattern continued after Nasser's death in 1970. His successor, Anwar Sadat, did little to regulate civil society during his presidency. Sadat reversed many of Nasser's policies, diplomatically aligning Egypt with the United States, signing a peace treaty with neighboring Israel, and launching a wave of neoliberal economic reforms known as the *infitah,* or "opening." Driven by structural adjustment programs sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the *infitah* opened the country to international trade and created new capitalist industries, dramatically reshaping the Egyptian economy.

After Sadat's assassination in 1981, newly-appointed president Hosni Mubarak spent the first decade of his rule once again consolidating the regime's power and balancing out potential challengers. While Nasser had marginalized the old economic and political classes, as well as the Muslim Brotherhood, Mubarak faced a radically different institutional landscape, thanks to Sadat's neoliberal economic reforms. Fueled by economic expansion in the 1980s and early 1990s, labor unions and a growing capitalist class posed a possible threat to Mubarak's new regime, especially since capital and labor have historically tended to be "the agents of democratization, not the allies of authoritarianism" [@Bellin:2002, 2]. To prevent these new economic classes from obtaining too much power, Mubarak structured economic reforms in ways that linked both labor and capital to his regime, supporting and co-opting labor unions, sponsoring industrial development projects, and incorporating capitalists into his cabinet and inner circle. As a result, the government stunted these actors' possible commitment to democratization and neutralized their risk. Throughout this consolidation of labor and capital during the 1980s and 90s, Mubarak paid little attention to domestic or international civil society—it was not a priority. This changed in the mid-1990s when, following with the predictions of the statistical model, escalating domestic instability at home combined with increasing internal regime consolidation to set the stage for the first statutory constriction of civil society since 1964. 

Between 1992–1997, militant Islamist groups carried out dozens of attacks throughout the country, killing more than 1,000 Egyptian civilians during a five-year insurgency. The offensive gripped the Egyptian media as the insurgents undertook high profile attacks, including an assassination attempt on Mubarak during a state visit to Ethiopia in 1995. At the height of the insurgency in November 1997, members of al-Gamaʿa al-Islamiyya gunned down 70 people—including 60 foreign tourists—in front of the Temple of Hatshepsut in Luxor [@Wright:2007, 243, 290–93]. Following the Luxor massacre, the government responded by limiting institutional dissonance across the board. In particular, because insurgent groups had been receiving funds from abroad, any institution connected with foreign countries became suspect—including domestic NGOs funded by foreign grants and international NGOs run by foreign employees. In 1998, state-run newspapers and television launched a media campaign linking foreign funding of NGOs to "dubious activities, corruption, profiteering" and labelled foreign-backed NGOs as threats to national security [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 113].

After stoking popular resentment against NGOs, Mubarak worked with the lower house of parliament to draft and pass new legislation to replace Law 32 of 1964. The subsequent Law 153 of 1999 allowed the regime to bring human rights NGOs under the umbrella of the state, ostensibly closing off the loophole they had previously relied on to avoid the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Social Affairs. The passage of this law shifted the regime's ideal point to the left, institutionalizing its reduced preferences for civil society activity. Accordingly, following the model, the size of the overlap in preferences—or the practical operating environment—shrunk. The provisions of the new law eliminated some of the "margin of free movement" that NGOs had previously enjoyed [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 120], gave the government jurisdiction over any organization "whose objectives or activities were similar to those of NGOs, even if it assumed a legal form that was different from that of NGOs and institutions," and forced hundreds of organizations to re-register [@FouadRefatMurcos:2005, 118].

However, in a move that frustrated this attempt to gain more control over civil society, the Egyptian Constitutional Court ruled Law 153 of 1999 unconstitutional the following year, declaring that it had been passed without consulting the country's upper house of parliament and that its provisions limiting civic space violated constitutional protections guaranteeing freedom of association. Reeling from this setback, the regime quietly tweaked the rejected law and passed it through both houses of parliament without public fanfare, resulting in Law 84 of 2002, or the Law on Associations and Foundations [@Agati:2007, 60]. In addition to requiring that all NGOs register with the Ministry of Social Solidarity, the new law imposed specific limits on international and foreign-connected NGOs. Any revenue from foreign associations to nonprofit organizations working in Egypt required both recipients and donors to submit multiple applications to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and state security, and the latter maintained ultimate veto power over the approval process [@Thabet:2004, 162]. 

In response to domestic crises and a spike in terrorism, the Mubarak regime formally redefined its ideal point. But, as seen in @fig:timeline-egy, the de facto CSRE remained constant after 2002. Though it granted the government substantial oversight power over NGOs, Law 84 also allowed for enormous discretion in enforcement. According to an Egyptian academic cited in a 2010 US embassy cable, the vast majority of Egyptian NGOs adhered to Law 84 obligations and registered with the Ministry of Social Solidarity. NGOs that did not register generally worked on contentious human rights-related issues [@10CAIRO217a], or had foreign connections. Though contentious foreign-sponsored and international NGOs were more likely to resist attempts at registering, many were able to navigate legal loopholes that Law 84 was supposed to have closed. Some NGOs registered as nonprofit "civil companies" rather than advocacy organizations, thus avoiding oversight from the Ministry of Social Affairs [@10CAIRO217a]. In 2007, there were rumors that the government was considering closing this civil companies loophole [@07CAIRO2067a], but such reforms never materialized and organizations continued to creatively maneuver the legal environment. 

While it might appear that Law 84's discretionary provisions gave NGOs substantial latitude, discretion cut both ways. If an organization became too contentious and posed a threat to the regime, officials could use minor infractions in more obscure parts of the law to fine or shut down the NGO. The legal pretext for the December 2011 raids on INGOs was that the organizations were not officially registered and thus in violation of Law 84. However, as I will show in Chapter 6, the organizations all had registration packets pending with the relevant ministries. The International Republican Institute, in particular, first applied for formal registration status in 2006 and was told that they could work in the country as long as the application was in process.[^2] When facing increased domestic instability, though, ministry officials revoked this discretion and expelled the organization.

### Civil society and internal threats to stability after 2011

Maintaining institutional balance is essential for autocrats to remain in power. In their early years, Nasser and Mubarak both focused their attention on coopting and neutralizing more powerful political actors, including politicians, parliament, the judicial system, Islamist movements, capitalists, and labor unions. After consolidating their power, both presidents turned to the management of civil society, which posed less of a threat to the regime and thus was a lower priority. Mubarak's Minister of Social Solidarity explained as much in a conversation with the US ambassador to Egypt in 2007, noting that the government was considering revisions to Law 84, but that the issue was "'not urgent' like the revisions to the 
election law or the new anti-terror law" [@07CAIRO2200a]. Following the 2011 uprising, however, the importance of civil society as an institution—in particular foreign-connected and international NGOs—would reverse and take center stage as SCAF, Morsi, and Sisi sought to consolidate power and regain regime cohesion and stability.

Post-revolutionary openness - like the model predicts. New regimes + little cohesion = leave more room for civil society

Law 84 governed state–civil society relations after the revolution, only getting replaced in May 2017. The government's discretionary use of the law increased substantially, driving the dramatic drop in the CSRE after 2012.

Post-revolutionary Law 84 discretion.[^3] + other laws, like protests laws, the penal code - discretion allowed regime to use civil society to maintain stability + stop NGOs that got too unruly

Egypt had little change in formal legislation between 2002 and 2011 because the 2002 law allowed for a lot of discretion - (2012 version of ICNL monitor says "Law 84 of 2002 is not so much restrictive as it is discretionary. Law 84 of 2002 gives enormous discretionary powers to the Ministry of Social Solidarity.")

Morsi to Sisi

The coup against Morsi in 2013 was yet another example of internal political machinations and regime incohesion leading to …………

Recent research has found that the mass popular rebellion against Morsi's regime was manufactured by security forces and the military, who secretly funded the leaders of the anti-Morsi protests [@Ketchley:2017].



Financial fragility in Egypt - Morsi was close to bankruptcy before the coup, GCC highly involved

Following the Arab uprisings of 2011, cohesion of regime collapsed. This fundamentally changed the relationship between Egyptian civil society and the state. Regime worked to fold CS into the state in a more formal way

President Morsi appears to have been aware of the trend of co-opting civil society in the service of the state and has attempted to continue—if not strengthen—Mubarak-era regulations of civil society organizations. In December 2012, Morsi announced new legislation that would nationalize all civil society organizations and treat them as part of the Social Affairs Ministry. NGO staff would be considered civil servants and would fall under complete control of the government ("NGOs reject draft law to nationalize civil society," 2012). The proposal was tabled following strong backlash from dozens of human and civil rights groups. However, the legislation reappeared in February 2013 when the Ministry submitted a final draft of the law to parliament with additional restrictions—as it stands, the law prohibits NGOs from participating in political activities, requires the retroactive registration of 40,000 organizations, and creates additional bureaucratic hurdles to receive approval for most aid projects (Halawa, 2013; Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, 2013). 

Sisi has continued this…

(Helpful timeline from POMED: [http://pomed.org/blog-post/egypts-escalating-campaign-against-the-ngo-community/](http://pomed.org/blog-post/egypts-escalating-campaign-against-the-ngo-community/))

Sisi's campaign of repression against domestic human rights community. Started as a campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood and Brotherhood-affiliated organizations in the wake of the pseudo-coup against Morsi, but has since expanded to domestic and international human rights organizations.

Even without official legislation, Egyptian authorities have used discretionary authority to target local activists and organizations.

- Sisi reopened Case 173, started under Morsi, to crackdown on local organizations. https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2016/12/close-case-173/; [http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/case-no-173-the-state-of-egypt-s-ngos](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/case-no-173-the-state-of-egypt-s-ngos)

In September 2016, a Cairo criminal court froze the assets of three of the country’s most prominent human rights NGOs—the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, and the Egyptian Center for the Right to Education—and froze the personal assets of key activists and organization directors.[^4]

Why now?

HRW connects it to instability, but only cursorily - points out that Egypt is less stable since Sisi took office, but based on the monthly average of terrorist attacks [https://freedomhouse.org/article/repression-and-instability-egypt-s-downward-spiral](https://freedomhouse.org/article/repression-and-instability-egypt-s-downward-spiral)

## Rising external threats

Thus far, concerns over domestic unrest and regime stability have driven the storywrt090 …

- Unrest in Palestine shaped Law 84. Arab Spring in general 
- The results of the model predict that the CSRE increases in the wake of growing neighborhood instability. 
- @fig:timeline-egy shows two dips in neighborhood stability - intifada in Palestine in the late 1990s, early 2000s, and Arab Spring.

The CSRE saw its predicted bump in the immediate aftermath of the 2011 revolution (prior to its crash in 2013), but the CSRE remained fairly stable during the 1990s and 2000s. 

## Reputation

Finally, reputational concerns appear to have played a minimal role in shaping either Egypt's formal INGO-related legislation or its de facto civil society regulatory environment. @fig:timeline-egy demonstrates this—the country faced low levels of international shaming in the press until Morsi's crackdown on protestors and the subsequent coup led to a spike in international condemnation in 2012–13. The drop in the CSRE correlates temporally with the increase in shaming, but when the shaming subsided following Morsi's abdication and el-Sisi's eventual rise to power, the CSRE did not rebound in turn. 

It is possible that preemptive shaming and unobservable diplomacy could have an effect on INGO regulations, but it is difficult to find evidence to support this. Wikileaks cables offer a glimpse into Egypt's reputational concerns. In August 2006, a delegation from the United States met with Egyptian government officials in a series of wide-ranging topics related to US foreign aid. During the meeting, the Egyptian Minister of Social Solidarity defended Law 84 and argued that the Egyptian government needed the law's powers to maintain a safe and healthy civil society regulatory environment. Distressed by the treatment of domestic and international NGOs in Egypt under Law 84 (and concerned with USAID's ability to partner with those NGOs when undertaking development projects), the National Security Council (NSC) Director for Democracy and Human Rights responded by requesting that the US be allowed to provide comments on the law, with the goal of "revising NGO legislation to bring it into compliance with international standards" [@06CAIRO5019a]. The US wielded its diplomatic power to attempt to influence NGO law reforms with an oblique reference to international reputation (i.e. appealing to the notion of compliance with international standards). However, no reforms ever took place under Mubarak, and NGO-related statutes did not receive any statutory updates until 2017. International reputation thus likely played little role in Egypt's NGO regulations.

Main obstacle for INGOs working in China is the need to be officially sponsored by a Professional Supervisory Agency (PSU) before registering with the Ministry of Public Safety. Local government partners are unwilling to become PSUs because of political risk for individual careers and agency reputation
No clarity about which agencies can count as PSUs - how to handle cross sectoral organizations that span multiple potential PSUs
Unclear what “political activities” means

Law requires INGOs to hire local accountants and staff, but smaller organizations can’t afford it. "The burden placed on such small groups is quite great and may result in an outflow of groups that do small but meaningful work in China"

Russia is a prime case for studying authoritarian restrictions on international NGOs. Though it is not formally defined as an autocracy (as its Polity IV score ranges between 0–6 since 1991), Russia—especially under the rule of Vladimir Putin—has long been accused of harboring authoritarian tendencies by both right- and left-leaning media and scholars.[^2] Post-Soviet Russia was also a proving ground for an emerging global civil society, and as thousands of Western funded NGOs began operations in the 1990s, tensions between domestic state sovereignty, foreign states, and international non-state actors boiled up, leading directly to a series of laws strategically tailored to curb international influence in Russia's domestic affairs. In this brief case study, I trace the development of Russia's regulatory environment for international and foreign-based NGOs since 1990, connecting key legislative restrictions with the most prominent internal, external, and reputational factors from the statistical models (see @fig:timeline-rus).

![Timeline of international NGO restrictions in Russia](../../Output/figures/2-timeline-rus){#fig:timeline-rus}

## Domestic and global civil society in post-Soviet Russia

As the international balance of power shifted away from Cold War two-superpower alignments in the early 1990s, non-state actors—guided in part by moralistic and capitalistic norms—gained significant prominence in global affairs [@Lipschutz:1992], and particularly so in newly democratizing Eastern Europe and Latin America [@Munck:2010]. Foreign foundations and private donors interested in democratization flooded Russia's nascent grassroots society organizations with aid in the early and mid-1990s, which provided hundreds of civil society organizations with valuable equipment and training and substantially increased their organizational capacity. This influx of foreign funds, however, changed the nature of domestic Russian NGOs and forged patron-client ties between international donors and Russian recipients, strengthening vertical ties between NGOs and foreign nations, rather than creating horizontal networks necessary for a more robust and socially responsive civil society sector. Instead of a strong grassroots civil society, foreign democratization aid in post-Soviet Russia helped created a "professionalized realm of NGOs, inaccessible to most local groups and compromised by its links to a neoliberal vision of development" [@Hemment:2004, 215].

In the first years of Boris Yeltsin's presidency, the Russian legal system was ill-equipped to handle this rush of foreign-backed grassroots civil society [@Henderson:2003]. The 1977 Soviet constitution contained provisions for creating social organizations to encourage education, sport, and culture, and the Communist party controlled and oversaw all state-approved organizations [@Albertie:2004]. With the collapse of the party and ancien régime, however, the new post-Soviet NGO sector was governed by outmoded laws that both stifled activists and prevented the government from controlling the sector. 

Internally, Yeltsin's early years were volatile and tumultuous. In the final months of 1994, internal political instability dropped to one of its lowest points, following months of high inflation rates, IMF-backed economic shock therapy, intra-regime conflict, and persistent constitutional crises. Most threatening to the regime's stability, however, was the direct threat of the Chechnya separatist movement, which had fomented since 1992. Yeltsin ordered an invasion of Chechnya in December 1994, launching a two-year civil war that would eventually end in stalemate. 

External threats to the regime also loomed large. Political risk throughout the Eastern European subregion mirrored Russia's own internal crisis, as the ICRG categorized the region with "very high" risk. The threat of uprisings, coups, and revolutions in the Balkans, Czechoslovakia, and other former Soviet republics, added to the already intensely risky political climate. 

In the midst of this tumultuous political milieu, the Russian Duma passed the 1995 Law on Public Associations, providing a legal foundation for regulating civil society in modern Russia. The law regulated the relationship between the government and NGOs and outlined bureaucratic procedures for establishing and maintaining NGOs [@Albertie:2004]. Importantly, though the 1995 law was not specifically targeted at international NGOs, the new regulations allowed the government to regain control over Russian domestic civil society and limit foreign influence. The law forced the registration or re-registration of all domestic and international NGOs by 1999, and failing to register led to liquidation and closure. On its face, reregistration was intended to update administrative information and improve government efficiency, but "in effect, the re-registration provision operated to eliminate troublesome and undesirable organizations" [@Albertie:2004, 20], and in particular organizations funded by foreign sponsors that dealt with human rights issues.

Reregistration proved to be a difficult hurdle for many organizations. Government bureaucrats wielded discretionary power in deciding which NGOs would be allowed to register, and NGOs were denied official recognition because of arbitrary issues, such as submitting applications with too many pages or an incorrect font size [@Albertie:2004, 22]. Ultimately, the 1995 law dramatically reduced the size of Russian civil society, as seen in @fig:russia-reregistration-before-after [@Grishina:2000]. Thousands of public associations throughout the country, many flush with foreign funds, shuttered their doors and ceased their work. 

![Effect of 1999 registration requirement](../../Output/figures/russia_reregistration_before_after){#fig:russia-reregistration-before-after}

As seen in @fig:timeline-rus, the 1999 registration deadline marked the start of the decline in Russia's civil society regulatory environment. By 1999, external threats had largely ceased—the subregion has had a "low" risk rating from ICRG from the late 1990s until today. Internally, political instability had improved during the mid 1990s, but dropped to its lowest point in post-Soviet history, receiving a "very high" risk rating beginning in late 1998. 

The events surrounding the 1995 Law on Associations generally support my theory. Internal political instability, driven in particular by an unregulated foreign-backed NGO sector, civil war, and domestic constitutional drama, appears to have helped set the stage for restrictive regulations that could be used discretionarily against foreign NGOs. More instability thus led to a worse legal environment. External regional threats and fears of contagion also likely influenced the legislation, contrary to the statistical findings. Finally, there is little evidence that shaming influenced INGO regulations during the 1990s.

## Vladimir Putin, part one: power consolidation and fears of contagion

Following the inauguration of Vladimir Putin in 2000, the general civil society regulatory environment steadily worsened as the new president worked to consolidate his power. Putin sought more direct control over the country's political institutions. In 2002, he ended elections for regional governors and gave himself the power to directly appoint regional officials, and thereby indirectly appoint their local legislative and judicial subordinates. Putin also took control of the country's last independent television network, threatened journalists (and allegedly assassinated the most vocal), and cajoled the country's rich oligarchs into cooperating with the regime [@Blitt:2008]. 

For Putin, it appears that domestic and international NGOs were yet another institution that needed to be controlled. From 2000–2005, Russia's CSRE steadily worsened as internal stability increased, contrary to both hypothesis 1 and the statistical findings. NGO-based power consolidation culminated in Federal Law No. 18-FZ, enacted in January 2006. This new law imposed dozens of additional registration requirements for NGOs and granted government bureaucrats additional discretionary powers to permit or deny legal status to NGOs. Most importantly, however, the law contained a bevy of restrictions targeted specifically at both international and foreign-backed domestic NGOs. 

Bureaucrats were empowered to deny registration to any foreign NGO if its "goals and objectives … create a threat to the sovereignty, political independence, territorial integrity, national unity, unique character, cultural heritage, and national interests of the Russian Federation" [@icnl-russia:2006, 2]. Additionally, the government gained new supervisory powers and required that NGOs provide details of all foreign funds, allow bureaucrats to observe or participate in any public or private event or meeting held by the organization, and ultimately determine whether an NGOs programming is appropriate and nonthreatening. The law also restricted foreign nationals, preventing anyone not legally residing in Russia from being a founder, member, or participant in any NGO [@Maxwell:2006]. As with the 1995 law, miscellaneous minutia placed burdens on foreign NGOs and often led to the revocation of their legal status—for example, the new law required that all registration materials had to be translated into Russian and certified by the government, but officials would often reject these certified translations, claiming they were "repulsive" and done poorly, forcing INGOs to pay for multiple translations [@Blitt:2008, 36]. 

According my hypothesis, the 2006 restrictions imposed on INGOs were unlikely. Putin passed the law at the height of his political consolidation, and the country was the most internally stable it had been since before the fall of the Soviet Union. Internal political risk improved steadily during Putin's first presidential tenure, though apparently at the expense of civil society, as the CSRE declined in concert with Russia's growing stability. External political risk was also extremely low, as Eastern Europe continued to be considered quite stable in spite of the ongoing second civil war in Chechnya. Inter-state condemnation and shaming of Putin began to rise in 2005 and 2006, but still remained relatively low. What, then, led to the additional restrictions?

Measurement error likely hides the overriding explanatory factor for these new restrictions. Three prominent Eastern European political revolutions—the 2003 Rose Revolution in Georgia, the 2004–2005 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, and the 2005 Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan—are not reflected in the regional or subregional risk score. In each of these revolutions, thousands of protestors took to the streets in mass demonstrations that eventually led the overthrow of each ruling regime. Both international NGOs and Western-supported domestic NGOs played a critical role in each color revolution. As in Russia, backed by millions of dollars in democracy assistance aid, global civil society had established itself as a powerful institution in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, but unlike Russia, none of these states had curbed the influence of the sector to the same extent. Subsequently, Western NGOs and civil society groups provided material support to aggrieved protestors and helped shape post-revolutionary governments [@Tudoroiu:2007].

Given their role in the color revolutions, Putin and his administration were concerned with the potential destabilizing influence of international NGOs, and the 2006 law appears to have been drafted explicitly to prevent and stave off revolutionary contagion from the region [@Machleder:2006]. Developments after the 2006 law provide some evidence for Russian fears of contagion. In an effort to realign domestic NGOs with Russia, rather than Western foundations and INGOs, Putin attempted to make the state the "primary financier" of the NGO sector [@CrottyHallLjubownikow:2014], thus heading off potential external influence. The government established the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation, a bureaucratic body responsible for doling out all federal funding to NGOs through competitive grants [@Richter:2009]. In theory, the Chamber would have allowed the state to sever the financial ties between NGOs and Western organizations, but ultimately, the Chamber has been wildly inefficient—in 2010, the Chamber awarded one billion rubles to 604 of Russia's 300,000 NGOs [@LjubownikowCrotty:2014, 766], and it has been widely criticized for its corruption [@Richter:2009].

Thus, the 2006 NGO law provides mixed evidence to support my hypotheses. As internal regime stability increased and Putin consolidated his power, the civil society regulatory environment worsened, contrary to the first hypothesis. External and reputational factors, as measured in the statistical model, have no apparent effect on the decision to pass the law, but unmeasured external factors—the threat of color revolution contagion—*did* have a demonstrably powerful effect on the legal environment and were likely the crucial factor for limiting INGOs in Russia. 

## Dimitry Medvedev: temporary thaw in state-INGO relations

In 2008, Dmitry Medvedev succeeded Putin as president, inheriting the former ruler's formidable consolidated political scene (and benefitting from Putin's support behind the scenes as prime minister). Instead of continuing Putin's more authoritarian consolidation, Medvedev engaged in some forms of liberalization and openness, and in November 2008, he offered NGOs an olive branch in his inauguration speech, calling for closer and more amiable cooperation between the government and civil society sector [@Flikke:2015, 5]. Medvedev met with NGO leaders in 2009 and promised to review the 2006 NGO law, ultimately passing several amendments to ease some of the strictest regulations, in particular not allowing bureaucrats to deny registration to organizations that threatened Russia's cultural heritage or national interests [@Jenkins:2012, 506–7]. 

However, this newfound openness did not last long. The Medvedev regime's internal political risk began to drop immediately upon taking office, and by 2010, discretionary and targeted restrictions on Western-related NGOs increased, leading to a new decrease in the overall regulatory environment for civil society. Contrary to the years of Putin's political consolidation, the CSRE and internal stability moved in lock step, as hypothesized—as stability worsens, so too do the restrictions on NGOs. 

## Vladimir Putin, part two: regional ambitions and new fears of contagion

Though data for the CSRE is only available through 2012, two important and highly restrictive pieces of legislation passed in 2012 and 2015 which have undoubtedly further diminished the index. All three hypothesized mechanisms appear to play a role in this most recent push to regulate and restrict international NGOs working in Russia. 

Reprising his fear of NGOs from his first term, in just a few months following his second inauguration, Vladimir Putin signed the 2012 Foreign Agents Law, which contained a set of strict regulations aimed specifically at stigmatizing international NGOs and any domestic NGOs that receive funds from abroad. Similar to the original 1995 Law on Associations, the 2012 law required that any NGO that either (1) received funding from or was based in a foreign country, or (2) engaged in any form of "political activity" (broadly defined) had to reregister with the government as a иностранный агент, or "foreign agent", a legal term of art laden with powerful symbolic meaning—traitorous spies working against the Soviet regime during the Cold War received the same appellation.[^3] Beyond the registration requirement, the law also required that foreign-connected NGOs prominently advertise the fact that they were foreign agents on all publications, pamphlets, and marketing. Failing to disclose this status carried a fine of up to 500,000 rubles—roughly US $7,000 [@Flikke:2015, 9]. 

Since the law was implemented in 2012, Russian authorities have enforced it far more vigorously than previous NGO regulations, increasing spontaneous inspections and shuttering and harassing organizations that did not voluntarily register [@Flikke:2015, 10]. By 2015, a third of foreign-connected NGOs in Russia had shut down and left the country.[^4] Subsequent regulations passed in 2014 sought to co-opt international NGOs, as Putin restored and transformed the Public Chamber as the primary domestic source for NGO funding, thereby attempting to dissuade domestic organizations from linking with foreign powers.

Most recently, the Duma (under Putin's influence) passed a set of amendments to the 2012 law—the 2015 Undesirable Organizations Law, which allowed the government to blacklist any foreign-connected NGO that it considered exceptionally undesirable. Prominent Western INGOs such as the Open Society Foundations, the MacArthur Foundation, Freedom House, Amnesty International, and the National Endowment for Democracy were all deemed undesirable and subsequently expelled from the country.[^5]

Given the internal political context, as well as persistent external threats to stability, Russia's rapid crackdown on the environment for foreign civil society organizations is not unexpected. By the time Putin resumed the presidency in 2012, Russia's internal political risk had fallen to its worst level since the first few years of Putin's first term. A confluence of economic and political factors stoked this internal instability, including a flagging economy, Putin's ambitions to expand Russian influence into the Middle East and China, and a latent interest in irredentism (which would come to full fruition with Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014). 

Interstate shaming of Russia increased substantially following Putin's inauguration and subsequent crackdown on civil society, though much of the international condemnation was not directly related to the regime's treatment of INGOs—rather, Western countries tended to rail against Putin's recalcitrance and newfound position as an authoritarian bogeyman.

As with the color revolutions preceding Russia's 2006 INGO law, the statistical model again fails to account for external instability and fears of contagion. In 2012, uprisings and revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, and others threatened authoritarian regimes worldwide, especially as the revolutionary spark appeared to spread throughout the region. Syria, in particular, posed a threat to Putin's international ambitions, as Syrian president Bashar al-Assad acted as Russia's regional client and openly received Russian support to fend off the revolutionary movement (ultimately launching the country into a still ongoing civil war). 

In parallel with 2006, fears of foreign meddling appear to be the overriding factor for the 2012 and 2015 laws. The architects of the 2015 Undesirable Organizations law revealed as much. Konstantin Kosachev, the chair of the committee responsible for labeling INGOs as "undesirable," argued in 2015 that

> The scale of the foreign NGOs’ activities in Russia is of a destructive nature and their aim is to overthrow the authorities in Russia. … Their main task is to try and make a direct impact on Russia’s internal political processes, intervene in them and in the long run ensure that a regime that is more loyal to these states (that finance the NGOs in Russia) come[s] to power [@Hamlett:2015, 7].

One of the law's cosponsors, Aleksandr Tarnavsky, linked the harshness of the new INGO restrictions with the external threats of foreign meddling in Ukraine, stating that

> Events in Ukraine have offended me, like many other Russians. Western countries audaciously spoke to us of friendship, while their secret services staged a coup hoping to tear Ukraine away from us. You act like that to us, then we’ll treat you the same. It’s pure pragmatism—nothing personal.[^6]

Tarnavsky argued that the strict regulations would loom large for INGOs, like a "weapon hanging on the wall and that never fires,"[^7] forcing them to toe the government line. The law was thus conceived of as a sort of defensive weapon against undue foreign influence, necessitated by ongoing fears of external instability.

Events leading to the 2012 Foreign Agents and 2015 Undesirable Organizations laws provide moderate evidence for my hypotheses. As internal political stability decreased (especially in response to Putin's irredentist annexation of Crimea and subsequent war with Ukraine) and threats of revolutionary contagion and external political stability increased, civil society restrictions intensified correspondingly, as anticipated. However, the regime was apparently not responsive to international shaming and condemnation.


# Cross-region comparisons

Compare Egypt, China, and Russia - similarities in how/why they regulate INGOs

- China: reputation
- Egypt: internal
- Russia: external

Diffusion of anti-NGO laws and INGO strategies partially based on interactive diffusion in @della-PortaTarrow:2012, where police and protesters anticipated each others' moves and strategies and shared information with their respective sides; their stuff is based on other work from the US civil rights movement, with southern elites and activists "adapting incrementally to each other's behavior at previous encounters" (143), but here this diffusion was happening across national boundaries

Authoritarians do the same thing, looking to peer countries (and INGOs do the same thing too, getting information through CIVICUS, etc.)
