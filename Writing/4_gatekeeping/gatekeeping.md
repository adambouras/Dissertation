In chapter two, I argued that authoritarian regimes see international NGOs as an institutional threat to regime stability. INGO experiences reinforce this finding, reflecting how many authoritarian host governments clearly see foreign NGOs as dangers. Survey respondents note that their relationship with the government is often affected by the political atmosphere of their host countries[^1] and that international NGOs in particular are seen as risky political actors.[^2] Some NGOs feel that accusations of acting as foreign political operatives are baseless and note that there is "much hue and cry about foreign money and agenda with out any evidence."[^3]

The foreign provenance of international NGOs appears to be the overriding trigger of fears for stability. A conflict resolution INGO working in East Africa argues that it is difficult to work with the host government because "any organization or investor from […] another country is viewed as a threat to the government of [the country], especially on issues resolving conflicts and human right[s]."[^4] Governments are especially wary of foreign organizations that work directly with citizens—for instance, one human rights INGO in East Africa feels like the government considers it a threat to national security when staff conduct trainings in the community.[^5] Fears of foreign influence are not limited solely to contentious organizations. An education INGO working in Southern Africa reports government suspicion of their pro-education advocacy and training, noting that "[t]he government is security and politically conscious, and have a negative view to gatherings of people. They take gatherings as opportunities for political influence."[^6]

Repressive governments have an incentive to limit the foreign influence of guest INGOs and mitigate their potential political risks. Recall, though, that the bulk of de jure civil society regulations in authoritarian countries target domestic, rather than international, NGOs. It is more difficult to directly regulate or control non-domestic organizations, since international NGOs are incorporated and managed by the laws of other countries. Attempts to control INGO activities within the host country can incur opposition from foreign countries, international organizations, and other larger international NGOs. 

Governments can mitigate the risks of international NGOs by employing regulations designed both to (1) filter out organizations before they enter the country and (2) limit the scope of their activities once they establish operations. These gatekeeping laws are not designed to distort or capture INGO missions, but rather to create a less inviting, less tolerant practical operating environment (see @fig:theory-regulation-purpose). Gatekeeping laws are designed to make life difficult for INGOs, introducing barriers to registration and adding obstacles to effectively undertaking their missions. An education organization working in Europe summarizes the effects of these laws succinctly, noting that "[t]hey do not have any major impact on pursuing our mission, they just regulate our administrative functioning, like registration, staff contracts and working hours, etc."[^7]

The amount of regulatory pressure INGOs face depends in part on the contentiousness of their relationship with their host governments. Gatekeeping regulations do not typically impose large burdens on non-contentious INGOs, as government and NGO preferences are aligned. Non-contentious organizations will typically maintain a good relationship with the government, follow registration laws, and keep their programming within the legal bounds set by the government. Gatekeeping laws put more pressure on high contention NGOs in an effort to limit their potentially destabilizing effects. Organizations with more instrumental flexibility will find creative ways to work around these restrictions or continue their work from abroad. INGOs with more limited resources, on the other hand, are less able to defend against regulatory intrusions into their flexibility and face more difficult choices, often hiding from the government or ceasing their programs and exiting the country.

# Entry gatekeeping: regulating registration

Registration is the form of regulation most clearly linked to goals of gatekeeping, and is one of the most common forms of government regulation of NGO activities—as seen previously in @fig:djcw-reg-regime, more than half of countries worldwide require that NGOs register with a government agency. NGO experiences with registration are mixed. More than two-thirds of responding organizations report feeling moderately or substantially affected by registration laws (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping), and as expected, organizations working on contentious issues are marginally more likely to face substantial restrictions:[^8] repressive governments place more pressure on organizations that are more likely to pose a political threat.

![Severity of gatekeeping regulations, divided by contentiousness](../../Output/figures/4-regs-faced-gatekeeping){#fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping}

However, feelings of restriction and actual registration are not necessarily linked—roughly half of respondents are *not* formally registered in their host countries (see top panel of @fig:registration-all), and there is no significant difference between the registration status of INGOs working either in autocratic regimes or working on contentious issues. Registration status is correlated, however, with organizations' overall perceptions of restriction (see bottom panel of @fig:registration-all). In both types of regimes, organizations that report not feeling restricted are the most likely to not be registered, while those that feel moderately restricted are the least likely to register. In the absence of strict registration laws, many INGOs can fly under the radar and avoid formal registration. For example, a development INGO in Latin America reports, "We're not registered… we just 'do our own thing'; so far the government has paid no attention to us in any way."[^9] As governments increase their enforcement of registration laws, INGOs feel more restricted and are more likely to be registered. However, the relationship between registration status and perceptions of restriction diverges for the most restricted INGOs. Organizations that report feeling the most restricted are just as likely to be registered as their unrestricted (and largely unregistered) counterparts, generally because it is exceptionally difficult and costly to formally register.

The experiences of responding NGOs reveals much about the effects of registration requirements on programming decisions. Organizations working in democratic contexts generally face little trouble in registering, noting that the process tends to require "just some formalities… [and] administrative work," such as submission of annual reports, board minutes, and basic financial statements to government authorities, which does not ultimately have any negative impact on their daily work.[^10] Those working in more difficult political environments shared differing experiences. Common complaints about registration dealt with its duration, cost, and arbitrary process. Organizations explain that "it takes a large number of steps to become registered [and] rules are not clearly articulated."[^11] INGOs working in highly autocratic countries like Cameroon, Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Nigeria report registration processes that take 3–7 years to complete, days of travel to government offices in capital cities, and thousands of dollars in fees and side payments.[^12]  Others also face arbitrary registration requirements invented by local officials, saying that "conditions have been added randomly on our NGO without any basis."[^13] In some countries, international organizations face a double registration requirement—an education INGO working in Latin America spent several years obtaining registration status only to discover that even with formal registration, they had to incorporate a domestic NGO to gain legal personhood and access to the banking system and courts, a process which took another four years.[^14] The bureaucratic bottlenecks do not necessarily end after this initial registration—a religious humanitarian services INGO working in the Caribbean spends at least three months every year working to secure annual renewal of that status, which imposes substantial administrative costs and causes delays in importing food and medical supplies.[^15]

When facing gatekeeping restrictions like registration laws, INGOs use their instrumental flexibility to make marginal adjustments to their programming to maintain overlap with regime preferences. Often, no adjustment is needed—most low contention organizations already overlap with regime preferences and willingly comply with registration regulations without issues. One development INGO working in East Africa represents the experiences of many other organizations, reporting that "because [our organization] is supported and invited by the […] governments themselves, we do not have problems with the ability to pursue missions. Being invited means that we are welcome to operate and pursue each mission," and because of their clear overlap with government preferences, they are "in complete compliance … with these rules and regulations without falter."[^16]   

When the distance between regime and ideal points is more distant and the relationship more antagonistic, INGOs use their flexibility and resources to act more creatively. Some organizations, for instance, seek out the friendliest and most amenable bureaucrats when registering or communicating with the government. A development INGO working in Oceania that was struggling to obtain permission to work in the country and import aid supplies stopped approaching ministry-level officials after repeated failure. Instead, they turned to local bureaucrats, who in turn obtained permission from their respective ministry heads.[^17] This workaround depends on the organization's instrumental flexibility, though, and is only possible with some knowledge of intragovernmental relationships—the INGO had to cultivate and understand those relationships over time in order to take advantage of them to expedite registration. 

More often, rather than creatively navigate the bureaucracy, organizations actively limit their contact with the government. It is important to note that this active avoidance of the government is different from the experiences of INGOs that are allowed to "do [their] own thing." In those cases, the preferences for both the government and INGO overlap and governments see no need to require registration or regular contact. In contrast, INGOs react with active avoidance when the government pulls back the civil society regulatory environment in an effort to control INGO activity. INGOs must wield and extend their flexibility to cope with this shift. Organizations will "avoid any contact with government officials"[^18] and work carefully to "reduce [their] visibility"[^19] in circumstances where registration and other gatekeeping rules are too restrictive, and exceptionally strict regulations can drive INGOs underground and severely inhibit their ability to carry out their mission. 

Sometimes INGOs change their headquarters within their host countries in response to increased government scrutiny. One organization working in Southeast Asia moved its headquarters to a more remote part of the country after local authorities became aware that they were not fully compliant with all regulations, while others working in Eastern Europe and Central Asia relocated to avoid uncooperative and "not ethical" officials who decided that the INGOs were not compliant.[^20] Finally, some organizations—particularly those with more contentious missions—move out of the country completely and work in exile because of the arbitrary (and targeted) enforcement of registration requirements.[^21]  

INGOs require sufficient resources and flexibility to engage in these strategies of active avoidance. Moving headquarters is expensive and time-consuming, and the organizations that report doing so tend to have more streams of revenue, employees, staff, or collaborative relationships than the average respondent. An organization working in the Middle East illustrates the importance of having increased flexibility to deal with registration restrictions.[^22] The INGO provides humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war and their host government is hostile towards them. The organization reports that "they do not want us to operate there" and that registration is difficult. As a result, the INGO actively avoids any contact with government officials and flies under the radar as much as possible. Though hiding from the government puts the organization at risk for expulsion and forecloses officially sanctioned streams of revenue from government ministries, the organization is able to sustain itself legally and financially through connections to other larger IGOs and INGOs like the World Food Programme, the Red Crescent, and large American churches, which provide the INGO with substantial funding and legal support.

In contrast, a humanitarian aid INGO working in the Caribbean provides an example of how low instrumental flexibility limits organizational effectiveness under strict registration regulations.[^23] The organization is not officially registered with the government, which leads to difficult legal consequences. The respondent says:

> It is a very complex and lengthy process to register a foreign organization. It cost over $10,000 and many, many trips into the capital to complete. It meant that for our first 7 years of operation, we were not an official organization and could not purchase property or vehicles in the org's name.

In the absence of legal standing and access to the courts or property registration system, the organization keeps its programming hidden as much as possible and even avoids putting logos on their vehicles or advertising their work to the public. While the organization is able to fulfill its mission of improving health in rural communities, it feels held back by its precarious legal situation and is unable to scale up, fearing the legal ramifications "if we grow big enough where we can no longer fly under the radar." The respondent identifies low funding as the primary barrier to both emerging from the regulatory shadows and to scaling up its operations. With more opportunities for fundraising and grant writing, the organization would be able to register and find firmer legal standing, but the absence of these resources "is holding back growth." The organization has not shifted its core mission to become friendlier to the regime, but its lack of flexibility has relegated it to the margins.

Finally, INGOs can find other bureaucratic loopholes and remain engaged in the country while in exile. Stymied by a complicated registration process, an organization working in East Africa gave up and began funding local NGOs instead of opening an official office in the country.[^24] Another working in Latin America hires consultants who are nominally associated with the organization, allowing the INGO to ensure that they have no legal organizational presence in the country.[^25] Other organizations try to maintain some presence in the country, but outsource compliance with laws to domestic partners that are better positioned to stay on top of the changing regulatory environment. Another INGO working in East Africa explains "[w]e partner with a local NGO which handles the internal regulations,"[^26] while one in Central Africa maintains an office in the capital city staffed entirely by locals, allowing the organization to follow domestic labor, tax, and organizational laws instead of stricter regulations targeted at international organizations.[^27] Regulatory outsourcing can enhance an organization's flexibility, as local staff are best positioned to "know the law… and the practices (traditions, curruption to avoid, conflicts to not engage in, etc.) [sic]"[^28] At the same time, managing in-country operations from abroad is costly and requires significant time and resources to remain effective. Organizations with greater instrumental flexibility can successfully work from abroad, while those that struggle with small staff, few volunteers, or limited funding can falter. 

A human rights INGO working in the Middle East illustrates the importance of high flexibility when working from exile. The organization faces two layers of strict gatekeeping regulations. Because the target country has banned the international NGO from opening an office in the country, the organization remains in Europe and partners with member organizations based in the target country. Recently, though, their partner organizations have also been banned from working in their own country and now work in exile as well. This imposes significant costs on the organization and has made their mission far less effective. Repressive gatekeeping laws limit the INGO's domestic partner organizations' "access to information, their ability to protect victims of human rights violations in the country, and to engage in advocacy with the public of [their country], all of which of course affects [our] ability to do the same."[^29] Despite these substantial barriers, the INGO has been able to continue its work in the repressive country because of highly professionalized staff and consistent external funding—it receives donations from dozens of OECD countries and large foundations like the Ford Foundation and the Open Society Foundations. Though its target country severely limits the practical operating environment, the organization can draw on its instrumental flexibility to continue its mission.

Thus, because these laws are aimed at controlling access to the country, INGOs facing registration restrictions strive to maintain their access. INGOs that have a more cooperative relationship with their host governments generally do not face difficulties complying with these regulations. When the relationship is more antagonistic, INGOs react to stricter registration regulations by drawing on their instrumental flexibility to creatively confront the rules or avoid the government entirely, all in the hope of avoiding shifting their core missions.

# Program gatekeeping: regulating assembly and speech

Registration laws are not the only mechanism for controlling INGOs. Once organizations are allowed in, governments can use laws that restrict freedom of assembly and speech to exercise gatekeeping power over the types of programs that are permitted. This allows governments to limit potential risks of foreign influence that could stem from INGO programming. Laws restricting assembly and speech are typically designed to prevent mass political and social protests, but these laws also affect many NGO programs, especially those of high contention organizations (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping)—low contention INGOs are marginally more likely to face no program gatekeeping regulations, while high contention INGOs tend to face substantial regulatory pressure.[^30]

One INGO working in Southern Africa explains that "the government is security and politically conscious, and have a negative view to gatherings of people. They take gatherings as opportunities for political influence. … The government associates international NGOs with politics which is not entirely true."[^31] Organizations engaged in more contentious advocacy are especially prone to enhanced government scrutiny and fears of political influence. The majority of respondents who reported substantial or moderate difficulties with limits on assembly and speech work on contentious issues (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping), but noncontentious organizations also get caught up in these additional restrictions. An organization in South Asia providing disaster relief downplayed government fears of the potential political influence of NGOs, condemning its host government's "hue and cry about foreign money and agenda with out any evidence."[^32]

The potentially political nature of INGO programming leads to stricter limitations on assembly. In a few highly repressive cases, there is a ban on all meetings, rallies, and protests,[^33] but such prohibitions are rare. Instead, respondents report that bureaucrats set the terms for the gatherings and grant or deny permission to meet. In most authoritarian countries, NGOs need police or government clearance to hold any public gathering or assembly.[^34] Activities must be pre-planned and demonstrably well organized, and even if all rules and regulations are followed, applications and permits can be denied or revoked arbitrarily and without explanation.[^35] INGOs also face restrictions on speech—a media development organization working in Eastern Africa has to receive ministry approval for all their scripts and training materials[^36] Even with permission to engage in speech or advocacy, there are still substantial risks: one human rights advocacy INGO working in Southeast Asia reported that ten of its members were arrested and imprisoned because they had participated in a peaceful political protest.[^37] 

How do INGOs react to and accommodate these restrictions? Again, because INGOs facing gatekeeping restrictions are most concerned with maintaining access to the country, organizations confront restrictions on assembly and speech by drawing on their instrumental resources and flexibility. However, unlike registration laws, which many organizations are able to skirt by flying under the radar and avoiding contact with the government, hiding more public activities like workshops, meetings, and rallies imposes heavier costs on organizations and carries a higher risk of punishment for noncompliance. As such, the majority of respondents lack the ability or will to marshal resources to challenge these laws and instead tend to comply with speech and assembly regulations and make their political neutrality quite public.

Organizations whose core missions do not involve large gatherings and protests actively eschew the appearance of politics: a human trafficking organization working in Southeast Asia noted that they "do not have problems with freedom to assembly since we are not engage in leftist activities [sic],"[^38] while a children's INGO in Eastern Europe sidesteps restrictions through the "simple use of discretion (avoid politically motivated gatherings) [sic]."[^39] Respondents also engage in frequent self-censorship to signal their benign intentions to their host regimes. Organizations are aware of "unwritten limitations to how much [their] advocacy work can go" and fear being seen as anti-regime, since crossing unstated government red lines encourages "government operatives [to] start looking for trivial faults as [a] way [of] shutting us up."[^40] Most INGOs "take care not to cross" these lines and pay deliberate attention to the phrasing of their public statements, avoiding any overt criticism of their host countries.[^41]

Similarly, organizations that are inherently more contentious—that cannot avoid the appearance of politics, or that offer public activities involving many participants—maintain access to the country primarily by following regulations regarding speech and assembly. Even many of the most contentious human rights INGOs attempt to obtain permits and official permission for their public-facing programming. For instance, in response to the arrests of its members and because of its inability to formally register in the country, the human rights INGO working in Southeast Asia changed how it trains its partners within that country and now communicates with activists online through Facebook Messenger and Skype.[^42] Other organizations make marginal adjustments to their programming to adhere to assembly laws without actually changing the core purpose of that programming. One organization implements its mission of teaching peace building and interfaith cooperation in countries facing religious and ethnic conflict by holding large-scale public events and workshops with thousands of attendees. Because speech and assembly laws in one of the Southeast Asian countries the INGO targets prohibit such events, though, the organization breaks these workshops into smaller, more frequent events, working with "hundreds, not thousands" at a time.[^43] 

INGOs are able to make these adjustments only when they have sufficient flexibility to do so. The human rights INGO in Southeast Asia works closely with European politicians and UN diplomats and has access to lawyers that can bring human rights abuse cases to local, European, and international courts. It also has the technical knowledge to help domestic activists access the internet safely, allowing for secure remote trainings and workshops. Similarly, the peace building INGO in Southeast Asia has sufficient money, time, and staff to host many small events in part because of its many collaborative relationships with several IGOs and large Western foundations. Without these resources, these organizations would not confront or adapt to the restrictions on assembly and speech and would struggle to maintain their access to their respective target countries. 

Thus, as with registration restrictions, INGOs facing assembly and speech restrictions are concerned primarily with maintaining access to the country. Confronting these laws, however, is more costly, risky, and not always necessary. When their core mission does not entail a political threat to the government, INGOs react by engaging in self-censorship or publicly demonstrating their political neutrality. When INGO programs are inherently political or are directly threatened by these regulations, organizations rely on their instrumental flexibility to avoid changing to their core missions.

# Article 19

Article 19 like Index, but Index doesn't set up offices, stays home in London. A19 works abroad, but is highly selective

IRI and Amera both left Egypt, but for different reasons


Expectations: organizations that are larger, better funded, that work with more organizations, employ more staff and volunteers, and have closer connections with local government officials are best able to adapt to changing gatekeeping regulations


## Mission and strategy

Article 19 was founded in 1987 by the children of American businessman and philanthropist J. Roderick MacArthur, who himself was the son of John MacArthur, a famous American philanthropist whose endowment established the Chicago-based John D. And Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. The younger philanthropist was a champion of civil rights who "believed that foundations should be at the cutting edge of social change" [@Nielsen:1996, 132]. Before his death in 1984, he laid out his vision to establish an international organization to combat censorship [@Fein:1992]. Though he died before the organization was incorporated, his children provided a $500,000 seed grant and founded what has become one of the most prominent freedom of expression NGOs in the world.

The organization takes its name from the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which establishes that

> [e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; the right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers [@udhr:1948, art. XIX].

In its 30 years of advocacy work, Article 19 has been motivated by a clear vision, working toward a world "where people are free to speak their opinions, to participate in decision-making, and to make informed choices about their lives"[^44] The practical contours of this vision have evolved over time. In its early years, Article 19 litigated and lobbied for imprisoned journalists, but over time has expanded its mission to encompass advocacy for all speech and information. Today, its stated mission is to "work so that people everywhere can express themselves freely, access information and enjoy freedom of the press."[^45] The organization has a wide ranging portfolio of programs that cover each of the three pillars of its core mission. First, a substantial portion of Article 19's attention is focused on protecting *individual expression*. The organization publishes research papers, issues statements, and releases advocacy letters that call on governments to maintain assembly and speech rights and discourage repressive regimes from passing laws to abrogate those rights. Article 19 also gets involved directly with litigation and lobbying, working with local lawyers to defend the rights of people imprisoned for self-expression and advising politicians and bureaucrats as they draft new laws to regulate expression. Second, the organization is concerned with ensuring *access to information*. Article 19 consults governments and lobbies for Right to Information (RTI) laws that guarantee access to public information and promote government transparency and accountability. The organization also advocates for progressive Information and Communication Technology (ICT) laws that guarantee access to the internet. Finally, Article 19 focuses on maintaining and promoting *freedom of the press*, again lobbying and consulting governments as they draft media laws, advocating for minimal press regulation, and shaming regimes that engage in violence against the press. The organization has had substantial success, setting international standards for freedom of expression and working directly with dozens of countries to establish and reform domestic laws regarding speech, assembly, and expression [@LandmanAbraham:2004, 32].

## Sources of flexibility

Repressive governments employ gatekeeping regulations to keep contentious INGOs outside of their countries or severely limit their activities within their countries. Article 19 has been successful in creatively adapting to the gatekeeping restrictions in the dozens of countries it targets because of its deep supply of instrumental flexibility. The organization's flexibility comes from multiple sources: reliable donors with deep pockets, regional offices located in stable countries near more repressive target countries, and dozens of professionalized staff with close connections to the government officials and bureaucrats best positioned to support freedom of expression-based legislative reform. 

Since its initial $500,000 grant from the J. Roderick MacArthur foundation, Article 19 has enjoyed a relatively steady flow of revenue. Though it accepts individual donations, the bulk of Article 19's funding comes from governments and large organizations. Roughly half of its income comes from various British government agencies [@Stroup:2012, 180], including the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the UK's Department for International Aid (DFID), and British embassies. The remainder comes from other foreign governments—primarily Sweden and Norway—intergovernmental organizations like the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the European Commission, and large American foundations and nonprofits such as the Open Society Foundations (OSF), the Ford Foundation, the William and Flora Hewlitt Foundation, and the National Endowment for Democracy (NED). Article 19 has been able to maintain a relatively steady flow of revenue over time, shifting and seeking out new grants as needed. For instance, after 2004, funding from the Open Society Foundations dried up, but the organization was able to replace it with grants from the Ford Foundation [@Stroup:2012, 180]. In general, the organization has maintained a balanced or surplus budget, which has allowed it to expand its operations to a global scale (see top panel of @fig:a19-budget-staff).

![Article 19's income, expenditures, and full time staff, 2004–15](../../Output/figures/4-a19-budget-staff){#fig:a19-budget-staff}

More importantly than steady revenue, however, is the alignment of Article 19's vision with that of its donors. To avoid mission drift, the organization seeks out foundations that already have a history of funding freedom of expression and anti-censorship work, such as OSF and the Ford Foundation. Article 19 consults with its donors to ensure that their visions and missions align. This is particularly important for the type of legislative advocacy Article 19 engages in—lobbying is expensive, time consuming, and runs a high risk of failure, even in democratic political systems. Article 19 staffers noted that foundations looking for guaranteed quick returns on their social investments can lack the patience and flexibility to fund the organization's lobbying efforts. One compared the slowness of their work with the Polish Solidarity movement in the 1980s, which received funds from Western donors while making little visible progress in promoting human rights until the fall of communist rule in Poland. The staffer observed that Solidarity would not have existed had donors thought about the movement like they do today, with donor emphasis on results-based outcomes.[^46] Evidence from @Bush:2015 supports this view, showing that donors' increasing emphasis on professionalization and measurable results has led to a taming of confrontational democracy assistance programs. Accordingly, Article 19 seeks out donors with longer time horizons and more permissive standards of results to ensure that their programs are not tamed by donor demands.

Another key source of flexibility is Article 19's geographic proximity to the countries it targets. Since at least the early 2000s, Article 19 has divided its advocacy work primarily by region, assigning staff to portfolios of countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa,[^47] each overseen by an expert program officer. The organization also maintains a issue-specific programs focused on legal issues, operations, and digital advocacy,[^48] covering its work across all regions. Prior to 2005, beyond a few small regional offices in Latin America, most of Article 19's staff were based in London, with program officers traveling regularly to their assigned regions and communicating with implementing partners remotely. In 2004, under the direction of executive director Agnès Callamard, the organization established a 5-year strategic vision that included a goal to strengthen Article 19's global presence, starting by exploring options for creating permanent local offices in each region [@a19:2005, 41]. By 2007, that goal had crystalized into a more specific target of establishing "a presence in all five regions by 2010, including through posting of staff, opening of local/regional offices, and/or institutionalised partnership (franchise) with local NGOs" [@a19:2007, 18]. 

![Article 19's headquarters and regional offices](../../Output/figures/4-a19-offices){#fig:a19-offices}

Between 2007–08, Article 19 established four regional offices in Kenya, Mexico, Brazil, and Bangladesh. Regional offices were later established in Senegal and Tunisia, and the organization today has a nearly global reach (see @fig:a19-offices). Each local Article 19 office is governed by its own local board of directors that is empowered to implement the programs organized and proposed by the central London office. Article 19's regional offices are less independent than the country-based affiliates of other human rights advocacy organizations like Amnesty International, whose country offices have enormous implementation power and strategic latitude [@Wong:2012]. Article 19's organizational strategy is coordinated and overseen in London by its executive director and senior management team [@LandmanAbraham:2004, 30] and supported by a core of roughly 20–30 permanent staff members. 

![Article 19 expenditures by region, 2011–15](../../Output/figures/4-a19-regions-expenses){#fig:a19-regions-expenses}

Beginning in 2013, under the leadership of its new executive director Thomas Hughes, Article 19's focus became substantially more global. The organization had previously spent the majority of its programming expenses on programs in Africa, with a peak in 2013 of nearly £1,000,000. Since then, however, African spending has been reduced and while programs in other regions have seen increased funding. Looking at the percent of money spent on regional programs highlights this shift more clearly. African programs had consistently accounted for roughly a third of all regional expenditures until the organization's global turn in 2013–14. By 2015, all regions received between 12 and 22 percent of the organization's expenses, with no clear outliers. Article 19's focus on global advocacy was made possible because of its network of regional and national offices, which the central organization with provide financial stability to engage in operations abroad. In conjunction with the normalization of its regional focus, Article 19 expanded its staff substantially between 2011–2013, quadrupling the number of full time employees (see bottom panel of @fig:a19-budget-staff) and spreading its new staff to its regional offices. More staff and regional experts deployed in national offices gives the organization increased access to government officials, enhances their ability to lobby governments, and allows them to stay abreast of regulatory changes. Article 19 systematically reanalyzes the legal environment of its host countries every few years and relies on its country experts to understand how changes in the practical operating environment might influence its ability to continue to engage in advocacy.[^49] 

A final source Article 19's instrumental flexibility is its close collaborative relationships with more than 90 different governments, IGOs, and INGOs.[^50] In addition to working closely with the British, Norwegian, and Swedish governments (who are its largest governmental funders), Article 19 was a founding member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX), a global network of advocacy NGOs created in 1992 [@Sharpe:2000, 46]. Today, IFEX boasts more than 100  organizational members, including prominent human rights organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Human Rights Watch, Reporters without Borders, and PEN International.[^51] Participation in issue networks like IFEX boosts Article 19's lobbying and litigation capacity and grants it access to countries and resources that are closed off due to gatekeeping regulations.

## Maintaining access to restrictive countries

Restrictions on individual freedom of expression have increased in concert with restrictions in civic space and associational life—authoritarian states are increasingly cracking down on both speech and civil society. While Article 19 is primarily concerned with maintaining freedom of expression, it must also confront the more restrictive legal operating environments in the countries it works in. The organization recognizes this, noting that "civic space isn't closing—it's closed."[^52] In the past few years, Article 19 has become more conscious about maintaining access to repressive target countries. Its 2014 annual report, entitled "Protecting Civic Space," not only outlined the organization's legislative and advocacy accomplishments from the previous year, but explained how more restrictive anti-NGO legislation had made it more difficult to engage in their work. Paddy Coulter, chairman of the organization, observed that "2014 was a year of growth for us: growth in the threats to information and media freedoms around the world but also in our capacity to respond" [@a19:2014, 3]. This "capacity to respond"—or what I term instrumental flexibility—has allowed Article 19 to creatively adapt to increasingly burdensome gatekeeping regulations over the past decade. In particular, the organization has made specific strategic shifts to allow it to cope with restrictions targeting both entry and its programs.

### Responses to entry restrictions

On its face, moving strategic planning and implementation away from the organization's central offices in London was designed to enhance the organization's access to remote partners, allowing it to "respond more swiftly to opportunities or crises, … be closer to [its] partners, work more closely with them, and thus be more capable to respond to their demands and strengthen interactions and capacities"[@a19:2008, 38]. Beyond enhancing the organization's programmatic efficiency by moving its experts to the field, decentralization also provided legal and regulatory benefits and allowed Article 19's central offices to better handle the complexities of each country's gatekeeping and registration regulations. These offices were formally registered according to each country's foreign NGO regulations, and to smooth the registration process, each office was established as part of projects funded by large donors. Article 19 Mexico, for example, was created in 2008 as part of an RTI advocacy campaign funded by the Hewlett Foundation—its local registration was incidental to the overall program. The other regional offices followed a similar pattern: Article 19 Brazil and Article 19 Bangladesh were both incorporated in 2008 while implementing RTI programs funded by DIFD, while Article 19 Kenya was registered in 2007 to undertake a project in Sudan funded by the European Commission and the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs [@a19:2008, 38]. Article 19 collaborated with its funders to overcome and avoid registration hurdles. Not only did bundling the registration of its regional offices with larger grants sponsored by governmental aid agencies like DFID and the European Commission expedite the registration process in each country, linking registration to grant fulfillment imbued Article 19's regional offices and programs with international backing and legitimacy.

Article 19 further ensured the success of their remote registration status by strategically selecting countries with the most amenable and navigable civil society regulatory environments, essentially choosing the "best house in a bad neighborhood" [@BarryBellClay:2015]. As mentioned previously, Article 19 reanalyzes legal trends in its various host countries to ensure that its mission aligns with the regulatory environments of its various target countries. Gatekeeping regulations factor into their decisions to expand to other countries. In the past decade, the organization has considered establishing a more formal presence in countries like Egypt and China, but concluded that the regulatory environments for INGOs in these countries would require too much effort and too many legal resources to keep any offices open.[^53]

When deciding where to expand its regional offices, Article 19 selects countries where it can have the most impact—both in-country and throughout the region—with the least amount of government interference. Brazil, Bangladesh, Mexico, Kenya, Senegal, and Tunisia each have more relaxed and friendlier laws than their regional neighbors. Registering as an international NGO in India, Ethiopia, Sudan, or Egypt, for instance, is more expensive, complicated, and risky than working from Bangladesh, Kenya, or Tunisia. The organization formally registered its office in Tunisia in 2011 precisely because it was the "safe option."[^54] Because post-revolutionary laws regarding NGO registration were more open than any other country in the region, Tunis became a safe central home base for Article 19's Middle Eastern work. 

The organization can afford to be selective in where it places its regional offices because of its large budget and international flexibility. Since it already has an established headquarters in London, it can take time to deliberate and debate possible regional offices. With consistent revenue, it can take more risks as it expands its programs. The Tunis office was formally incorporated in 2011, but as explained below, Article 19 has been active in Tunisia since at least 2004. Rather than establish regional offices from scratch, the organization builds on existing work and connections. Additionally, because it has multiple programs spread across the world, the organization can close and relocate its offices more easily. In the 1990s, prior to the organization's official policy of decentralization, it incorporated Article 19 South Africa as a regional subsidiary organization. Rising operational costs and increasing difficulties with coordination led to the office's closure in 2004 [@Stroup:2012, 180; @a19-fin:2004], but leaving the country did not have an overly negative effect on the Article 19's programs in the region. From its base in London, the organization continued to hold workshops, lobby politicians, consult bureaucrats, and litigate against censorship throughout the region in 2004 [@a19:2004; @a19:2005]. While it has not yet been forced out of any of its current regional offices because of gatekeeping regulations, past experience shows that Article 19 would likely be able to absorb and adapt to such a change because of its flexibility, shifting resources and staff around to different regional or home offices.

### Responses to programmatic restrictions

Gatekeeping laws exist not only to filter out organizations that can cause potential political risks—governments can enact legislation or arbitrarily implement existing regulations to make life difficult for organizations already in their countries. While registration laws predominantly affect Article 19's regional offices, the organization must contend with regulations that target and restrict the organization's programming in all countries where it engages in advocacy, including countries where it does not have a permanent formal presence. In its 2014 annual report, dedicated to closing civic space, Article 19 noted that programming restrictions—particularly legal and security threats against in-country staff—were one of the most urgent challenges to undertaking its mission. Executive director Thomas Hughes observed, "Unfortunately, 2014 was marked by a deteriorating security environment for us and our partners. Threats against staff increased, mirroring the global trend of greater suppression and restriction of individuals and institutions defending human rights" [@a19:2014, 4]. 

Article 19 has responded to rising security threats by increasing its spending on security services, hiring and contracting additional guards, translators, fixers, and support staff. This additional security support has allowed the organization to continue its work in its various target countries, but it has imposed significant costs and increased expenditures by roughly 10%.[^55] For instance, in 2014 one staff member was detained in Ethiopia on his way to conduct a safety training workshop. Immigration officials confiscated his passport and phone and denied him access to legal advice [@a19:2014, 15]. In response, Article 19 had to unexpectedly increase its Ethiopian advocacy, lobbying against the government both for imprisoned journalists and bloggers and for the safety and continued access of program staff in the country. Similarly, following the passage of a new anti-terrorism and national security law in Kenya that granted the government the ability to arbitrarily reexamine or cancel the registrations of civil society organizations,[^56] Article 19 increased both its security spending and its litigation against the regime, responses made possible by the organization's reliable access to revenue and its professional legal staff. 

In many of its target countries, laws and regulations prohibit Article 19 from engaging in different forms of advocacy. The organization has a diverse menu of possible advocacy activities, and it selects which programs to offer based on both the needs and the practical  operating environment of the target country. Because Article 19 works in dozens of different countries and engages in a wide variety of forms of advocacy, it can match its programming to its host legal environment, continue its mission, and maintain some access to the country without fundamentally changing its vision.

In countries with strict blasphemy laws, for instance, the organization faces intense opposition to its pro-speech litigation and its attempts to repeal those laws. In Sudan in 2008, the organization created the Khartoum Advocacy Centre Blog and worked with local lawyers to advocate on behalf of a journalist imprisoned on charges of blasphemy. However, in 2009, following government hostility and threats, Article 19 closed down the blog and helped its local partners leave the country [@a19:2009, 7]. The organization adopted a "new strategy of interventions" targeted at Sudan and has continued its advocacy efforts from exile, criticizing the country for censorship and speech-based discrimination through regular reports and through presentations before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights [@a19:2009; @a19:2011]. In the case of Iran, which prohibits all speech that promotes homosexuality, all of Article 19's LGBT-focused advocacy occurs online only, and the organization makes no attempt to have a physical presence in the country.[^57] Gatekeeping laws focused on INGO programs keep Article 19 out of the country, but through regular contact with exiled activists and their prolific use of internet publishing (as seen in @fig:a19-me-reports, Iran receives the most published attention in the Middle East), the organization continues to engage in its mission of promoting freedom of expression. Article 19's diverse menu of programming enables it to creatively respond and adapt to regulations that restrict its in-country activities.

As Article 19 regularly notes, the rights of expression and assembly are deeply linked: "the defence of freedom of expression and access to information is essentially the defence of civic space" [@a19:2014, 8]. Because improvements expression rights one lead to improvements in the assembly rights, one of Article 19's more unique responses to legal restrictions on civil society is to lobby the government for regulatory and statutory reforms in both expression and assembly, advancing "progressive interpretations of human rights laws that allow people to gather, speak, and seek information" [@a19:2014, 8] and "embed[ding] freedom of expression in the infrastructure of government" [@a19:2015, 31]. Article 19's litigation and consultation on issues of freedom of expression allow the organization to shape the legal environments of its target countries. This, in turn, has powerful knock-on effects: improving the legal environment in one country allows the organization to maintain its access throughout the region. 

Tunisia provides a prime example of this phenomenon. Article 19 began working in the country in 2005 as part of the Tunisia Monitoring Group (IFEX-TMG), a special eight-year endeavor organized by IFEX. Working with regional and international partners such as the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, Index on Censorship, Freedom House, and the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, IFEX-TMG sent regular fact-finding and consulting missions to Tunisia, culminating in multiple reports outlining legislative recommendations to enhance media freedom, end censorship, and improve the rights of association, assembly, and movement [@ifex-tmg:2005; @ifex-tmg:2010]. Under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, few of the recommendations had a change of being implemented. However, following the president's overthrow during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising, Article 19 was ideally positioned to influence human rights policy in the country, and it opened a formal regional office in Tunis. Building on relationships established during IFEX-TMG missions, newly-elected Tunisian politicians solicited technical advice from Article 19 on issues related to freedom of expression and human rights more generally. The organization held workshops for legislators, offered regular comments on the nascent constitution, and worked with the president and party chairs to ensure that the legal environment for speech and assembly in the newly democratizing country would be safe and inviting [@a19:2012]. In January 2014, the country's National Constituent Assembly (NCA) adopted a new constitution that generally accorded with international human rights standards. Prominent politicians cited Article 19's assistance throughout the drafting process, including interim president Moncef Marzouki and NCA president Mustapha Ben Jafar [@a19:2014, 16].

The final post-revolutionary constitution was not perfect, and subsequent governments have continued to infringe on expression rights. However, secure in its legal status, Article 19 has been able to maintain the contentiousness of its work in Tunisia, issuing 87 advocacy letters and statements since the fall of Ben Ali in 2011 (see @fig:a19-me-reports), condemning government abuses, censorship, and arrests of journalists and activists. The organization's close connections with local politicians—as well as the more permissive legal environment for advocacy in general—allow Article 19 to continue its mission and litigate against the government.

![Advocacy letters, reports, legal analyses, policy briefs, press releases, statements, and updates published by Article 19 in the Middle East, 2011–2017](../../Output/figures/4-a19-me-reports){#fig:a19-me-reports}

Additionally, Article 19 has been able to use Tunisia as a regional home base. Egypt, Syria, Bahrain, and other Middle Eastern countries have all imposed strict gatekeeping regulations, either by preventing registration or by imposing rules that make human rights advocacy illegal. To get around these restrictions, Article 19 brings regional activists to its Tunisia office for training and research, rather than sending staff to those more restrictive countries.[^58] As a result, despite closed and dangerous civic space, Article 19 has been able to maintain the contentiousness of its post-Arab Spring advocacy, issuing reports and policy briefs to countries throughout the region (see @fig:a19-me-reports). Using its Tunisian office as a regional hub and tool for circumventing gatekeeping laws, however, is only possible because of the organization's instrumental flexibility. Collaboration with IFEX-TMG, politicians, and local NGOs in the years prior to the revolution, consistent government- and foundation-based funding, and highly trained staff allowed Article 19 to rapidly establish an office in 2011 and have positioned the organization to remain active in the region.

## Mission and strategy

## Sources of flexibility (and inflexibility)

Inconstant revenue, revenue going to separate entities - like how in 2012 the majority of funds went to Uganda, caused a huge deficit

![AMERA's income, expenditures, and full time staff, 2004–15](../../Output/figures/4-amera-budget-staff){#fig:amera-budget-staff}

Small staff - that's fine, Article 19 has a small staff too

Partners - lots of partner organizations in Egypt, which helped

![AMERA's offices and primary partners](../../Output/figures/4-amera-partners){#fig:amera-partners}

Donations mostly from Comic Relief, with its global Red Nose Day - Some foundations too, like Ford Foundation in 2007, and embassies

Fiscal year ends on January 31 - to align it with a standard calendar year, I move everything back one year, so the financial report for the year ending on January 31, 2009 counts as 2008.

2012 - first notes about precariousness of Egypt security - created backup plan in case office has to close

2014 report - activities all focused on transitioning out of the country, moving operations to other organizations like EFRR - staff drops to 1, ED in the UK

Now EFFR and St. Andrews in Egypt

## Reactions to restrictions

mostly just registration ones, not programmatic ones - laws regulating speech, assembly, advocacy weren't ever an issue - it was all about security and registration

Gatekeeping - it tried to follow the law in Egypt, registration process began in 2010 prior to the revolution - no huge rush to do it - regulations in Egypt were discretionary more than anything, so it was more of just getting around to finally registering

Revolution was bad for the organization - forced them to shut down for a while, work offsite. They're not a contentious organization though, so they weren't seen as a political threat

Registration continued, restarted in 2012, but still nothing came through. Security situation became worse, legal situation became more precarious, etc. But they persisted. The practical operating environment became more constrained, but they were able to continue their work regardless, relying heavily on their Egyptian partners

All this coincided with a severe resource crunch - they

2012 - Identified new partners in Morocco (Droit et Justice) and Cameroon (REWAC; Refugee Welfare Association Cameroon), but focus was primarily on Egypt - registration process continues - reserves set aside in case of closure
2013 - Big influx of refugees from Syria that put pressure on AMERA Egypt's services - still waiting for registration status
 - Decided to merge AMERA with the Egyptian Foundation for Refugee Rights "in order to provide security and sustainability for the programmes, clients, and staff" - lack of registration = main culprit - "The continued lack of registration of AMERA Egypt has posed a large threat to the continuation of services to refugees in Egypt. In order to ensure sustainable programmes and security for clients and staff, the Board decided that this risk was best mitigated by merging AMERA Egypt's programmes with those of an organisation that was already registered in Egypt, the Egyptian Foundation for Refufee Rights"
	 - Turned more to on-the-ground partners like Refuge Egypt, Caritas, ICRC, St. Andrews Refugee Services, Catholic Relief Services, and the El Nadeem Center for Psychological Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture
2014 - name changed to International Refugee Rights Initiative (IRRI) - programs fully transferred to EFRR - grants to them now + to Droit et Justice
2015 - name change from IRRI to Amera International Limited - main focus is finishing the transition to EFRR, biggest risk = legal threats + security threats, mitigated by integrating programs with EFRR

Programs - pro bono litigation and advocacy for refugees, sex and gender based violence (SGBV) survivors, trafficking,  - resettlement (as of 2010 only NGO in Egypt with a direct referral system with the US State Department), unaccompanied minors, refugee status determination

Super hard to rely exclusively on one constant stream of fundgs
2011 - Objectives finally laid out - three ¶s here

Relies on staff + volunteer interns + partnerships with local law offices

# Conclusion

Main advice from A19: Be friends with national, local, host governments

Article 19 was successful in proactively reshaping the associational and speech laws in Tunisia because of its longstanding relationships with key government officials and its deep connections with local partners and larger networks of similar INGOs. As a result of the more open legal environment in Tunisia, the organization has been able to maintain the contentiousness of its work there and throughout the region.
