As explained in the previous chapter, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), foreign foundations, private donors, and scholars of international affairs flooded the Russia with aid and technical assistance. Among the most prominent early foreign entrants into the country's nascent civil society and political sectors were the Open Society Foundations (OSF), a philanthropic advocacy organization funded by American billionaire George Soros, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace—America's "oldest international affairs think tank"[^1]—which created the Carnegie Moscow Center as a regional research hub. Throughout Russia's tumultuous post-Soviet history, OSF and the Carnegie Center were influential proponents of political liberalization and democratization. The  two organizations pursued different strategies—OSF funded and supported domestic NGOs working on issues of education, freedom of expression, and human rights, while the Carnegie Center supported scholars and foreign policy experts in Russia and abroad, funding and disseminating white papers, reports, and general research and advocacy for Eastern European liberalization—but the two shared the same fundamental goal of improving human rights and the rule of law in Russia and the region.

In December 2015, after more than two decades of advocacy in the country, OSF ceased all operations in Russia, terminated all its ongoing programs, and stopped funding local Russian NGOs. The Carnegie Center, meanwhile, continues its research in Moscow today. OSF had been forced to leave after being deemed an "undesirable organization" earlier that year—a new legal status created by a 2015 law passed by the Putin administration that allowed the government to blacklist and expel any organization it felt was too dangerous and threatening. 

OSF's expulsion in 2015 followed three years of heavy legal restrictions. After Vladimir Putin was inaugurated as president for a second time in 2012, he almost immediately turned the regulatory environment against INGOs and foreign-backed NGOs. The administration passed a 2012 law designating a subset of foreign-connected NGOs as "foreign agents," recycling a Cold War-era term reserved for anti-Soviet spies and collaborators,[^2] and more than 100 domestic NGOs have been labeled as such.[^3] The 2015 Undesirable Organizations law expanded this 2012 legislation and specifically targeted international human rights NGOs. The government's initial list of undesirable organizations included just five INGOs: Human Rights Watch, Memorial, Amnesty International, OSF, and the Carnegie Moscow Center,[^4] but by the second draft of the list, the Carnegie Center had been removed and spared the chopping block.[^5] 

For decades, OSF and the Carnegie Center had shared similar experiences with harsh legal restrictions in Russia, but in 2015, the two organizations diverged dramatically. Why did one continue to work in the country while the other withdrew?

According to a high-level OSF program officer, a crucial factor for deciding to support NGOs in a country is the safety of the activists and organizations they support. If the Foundations' support of an organization leads to jail time, harassment, or otherwise impairs or imperils those they support, they withdraw or halt that support. OSF does have a clear, calculated, and rational vision for how it operates. The decision to stay or leave a country is based primarily on how well the organization's work promotes change. If OSF can no longer make satisfactory change, whether because of the legal environment, local political developments, cultural shifts, wars, revolutions, or any other external factor that influences their ability to affect change and reform, the organization reaches a tipping point where "the jig is up" and they withdraw and move their resources elsewhere. OSF is motivated by cost-benefit utility function that determines how they allocate their programming and funding. Through their "judicious calculus," the foundation works to balance the need to affect satisfactory change against the injunction to "do no harm" and need to guarantee the safety of their partners. Pragmatism drives their organizational decisions.[^6]

In contrast, the Carnegie Center was motivated by a different set of core principles and values. Because the organization has historically produced detailed research on international and regional political affairs, it has long prized its cozy access to Russian government officials. As Putin's regime began to crack down on INGOs starting in 2012, the Center adjusted its strategy and programming to remain in the country. Three of its most outspoken liberal researchers and activists were let go between 2012–2014, replaced with research fellows more friendly to Putin. Few of the Center's public events since 2012 have discussed internal Russian politics or Putin's push to become a stronger regional—as Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, the Center generally remained silent [@Kirchick:2015]. The Carnegie Center's desire to remain in the country drove its organizational decisions, but at the cost of potentially compromising its reputation and reducing the value of its programming. 

This sharp divergence between OSF and the Carnegie Center illustrates a broader trend occurring on a global scale. Since the 1990s, INGOs have emerged as a cornerstone of global governance [@Lipschutz:1992; @AhmedPotter:2006] and have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes. Autocrats, in response to internal, external, and reputational pressures, work to regulate and restrict the activities and programming of international and foreign-funded NGOs working their countries. These regulations and restrictions often force INGOs to make difficult organizational decisions. What determines when INGOs comply with legal restrictions (like the Carnegie Center), resist government intrusions into organizational practices, or pull out of the country entirely (like OSF)? Why do INGOs work in these regimes if their services and advocacy can potentially help the regime? More generally, how do INGOs adapt to their institutional context and what tactics do they use to stay in engaged in the countries they target? In this chapter, I shift the argument away from determining why autocrats regulate international NGOs and look instead at how the political, legal, and regulatory institutions of INGO target countries affect these organizations' strategies and programming. I return to the theory of amicable contempt to explain and predict how INGOs respond to government regulations and restrictions, given the balance between organization's core principles and its instrumental flexibility. 

# What influences INGO behavior?

INGOs have long been treated as a "black box" in much of the existing academic work on international institutions, and have often been assumed to act as altruistic bulwarks against the state, filling policy and issue gaps in the international system, and run by managers with only the best intentions [@Corry:2010; @Skjelsbaek:1971; @NyeKeohane:1971; @Bartelson:2006]. In the past decade, however, scholars have worked to move beyond this simplistic view and uncover the determinants and effects of INGO behavior, treating transnational actors as both normative and strategic [@Cooley:2002; @Keck:1999; @Kelley:2009a].@PrakashGugerty:2010a helped formalize this newer trend, arguing that advocacy INGOs should be seen as firms working in policy markets, driven by normative and instrumental concerns, and motivated organizational survival and growth. Seen in this more nuanced light, it is clear that, like firms, INGOs are subject to interagency conflicts, face issues with accountability, compete for scarce resources, and struggle to get their issues on the global agenda. In previous work with Tana Johnson [-@HeissJohnson:2016], I explore a useful typology for this newer body of work, organizing these emerging structural determinants of INGO behavior into three related and interlocking categories: (1) the internal structure of the INGO, (2) the external dynamics and relationships faced by the INGO, and (3) the institutional context that defines the boundaries of INGO action. 

## Internal traits

A significant portion of INGO behavior is shaped by the preferences and ideals of its managers, employees, and volunteers, who in turn shape the organization's stated mission, vision, and values. For example, an organization's managerial structure can influence the success of its programming. @Wong:2012 shows that INGOs can centralize or decentralize different forms of managerial power: the power to propose new goals and missions, the power to enforce those goals, and the power to actually implement those proposals. Organizations that successfully centralize proposal power while decentralizing implementation power are better able to pursue a central agenda without stifling local creativity, thus leading to better success [@Wong:2012].

## Interactions with other actors

INGOs do not operate in isolation—even if an organization perfectly balances and refines its internal managerial structure, it still must interact with third-party actors as it pursues its policy agenda. An INGO's interactions with these other external actors shape its behavior. Early work on opening the INGO black box focused on many of these external factors. For example, @Cooley:2002 argues that competition among INGOs actually leads to perverse outcomes and sectoral insecurity, as organizations will often undermine their competitors, withhold information, act unilaterally, and seek government rents. Additionally, @Bob:2002 shows that INGOs compete in a "harsh, Darwinian marketplace where legions of desperate groups vie for scarce attention, sympathy, and money" [@Bob:2002, 37]. Organizations that are experts at emotive marketing, employ native English speakers, use charismatic spokespeople, and craft their messages to fit Western sensibilities are far more effective in the global community than their competitors. 

The relationships that form as organizations interact also have a direct impact on INGO power and influence. @Carpenter:2014 demonstrates the importance of the shape and nature of INGO networks. INGOs are most able to push new normative ideas onto the global agenda if they are connected to key nodes—or gatekeepers—in a network, who then vet the proposals and give (or deny) them credibility and legitimacy. In general, the more connected or centralized an INGO is in relation to other organizations, the more influential it will be. @Murdie:2014 provides additional evidence of the power of INGO networks, finding that human rights INGOs that network and collaborate together increase their advocacy output. The nature of these network relationships influences the quality of this work, though—as more organizations free ride and rely on larger, more prominent INGOs, advocacy output decreases.

## Institutional environment

Beyond the influence of internal and external actors, INGOs are also shaped by more ephemeral concepts—the political structures and institutions they interact with [@HeissJohnson:2016; @GugertyPrakash:2010; @BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. INGOs are products of the legal regulations, historical precedents, political trends, and cultural norms of both their home countries and they countries they target, all all of which define the boundaries for INGO operations. 

In contrast with internal NGO traits and interactions with other actors, the effect of the institutional environment on international NGOs is relatively understudied [@BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. @Stroup:2012 shows that the organizational structures and missions of INGOs are deeply tied to the cultural and legal environments of their home countries. For example, she argues that CARE USA's mission reflects American norms of efficiency and results-oriented pragmatism by using a professional staff, securing large amounts of government funding, and avoiding anti-American advocacy. In contrast, Amnesty International, based in the United Kingdom, eschews many of the stricter norms of business-like efficiency and professionalization to focus more on advocacy work. Additionally, because Amnesty International refuses government funding (in part because of the historical absence of government funding for charities), it focuses much of its advocacy work on British and American human rights abuses. 

Emerging research on domestic nonprofit organizations in the United States can inform future research into INGO behavior, revealing how NGOs both (1) are adversely affected by the rules, regulations, and institutional structures governing NGO activities, and (2) manipulate those structures for their own benefit and organizational survival.

First, institutional rules and norms can create inefficiencies in nonprofit programming. For instance, NGOs often change their behavior to obtain external government funding. Government grants (both domestic and foreign) limit the flexibility of nonprofits by imposing strict reporting requirements that can shift these organizations' missions [@Suarez:2011], and by crowding out private donations [@KimVan-Ryzin:2014]. Government grant requirements often insist that applicant organizations pursue specific behaviors, such as collaboration with other organizations, even if collaboration is not the optimal strategy for the organization. In fact, because of this push for collaboration, regardless of its consequences, one of the best predictors of a nonprofit organization receiving government funding is whether or not it collaborates with other nonprofits [@Suarez:2008; @Suarez:2011]. As these organizations create inefficient collaborative networks, organizational objectives and missions are often dropped or discarded in pursuit of additional funding, resulting in a market failure [@WitesmanHeiss:2016]. These inefficiencies are directly tied to the structural incentives to collaborate, pushing organizations to adopt suboptimal strategies in the interest of securing funding. Foreign NGOs suffer similar inefficiencies and crowding out effects [@GugertyKremer:2008], but work remains for research on international NGOs.

Second, rather than shift and adjust their organizational missions and values to fit the legal environment, many American nonprofits maneuver *within* that environment and find workarounds for their preferred strategies. That is, nonprofits in the United States generally do not change their missions—they change their legal and organizational structures to make their missions happen.[^7] In the United States, nonprofits typically incorporate initially as 501(c)(3) organizations. While this designation provides significant tax benefits (i.e. full tax exemption), IRS regulations restrict some of the activities and income generation strategies these organizations can pursue. In order to become more politically engaged, nonprofits will often create a 501(c)(4) or (c)(6) subsidiary, which offers fewer tax benefits but allows for direct political advocacy. Similarly, IRS regulations impose an operational test on nonprofits' business activities. If an organization generates significant unrelated business income (UBI) it can fail this test and lose its exempt status. To prevent this from happening, 501(c)(3)s can spin off for-profit subsidiaries that channel income into the main organization [@Daniel:2014; @SloanGrizzleKim:2015]. Ultimately, US nonprofits learn to deftly maneuver the legal regulatory environment to maximize their revenue and carry out their preferred programs.[^8] 

Like their domestic counterparts, international NGOs also engage in creative and strategic adjustments, taking advantage of the legal environment to shape their programming and protect their resources and funding. However, international NGOs working in dictatorships face especially difficult choices. Maya Wang, a researcher with Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong explains this dilemma: 

> To work around [authoritarian] restrictions NGOs can work on less sensitive topics, with friendly government officials, partner with local organisations and try to funding sources that aren't considered "sensitive." All of that is being done very creatively by many on the ground. But, we have to ask ourselves whether doing so might compromise one's original intentions. Helping the government maintain the status quo in some ways undermines long-term prospects, as ultimately civil society does need a free press, a democratic government and freedom of association [@Leach:2014].

Pushing the envelope with organizational and legal innovations in these countries is a doubled-edged sword: if an INGO gets too creative in spinning off subsidiaries, partnering with domestic NGOs, or redefining its mission, it can either change its mission so much as to support the government and help keep it in power, or it can run afoul of the government and be expelled.

# Explaining INGO responses to authoritarian regulations

## Theoretical framework

An INGO's mission and menu of programs will often conflict with the preferences of the regime. Accordingly, an organization must decide how to adapt its programming to fit the requirements and needs of its host country. This decision can be difficult, pitting conflicting organizational values against each other. If the organization is too antagonistic, contentious, or principled, it runs the risk of expulsion, potentially leaving the INGO unable to continue its work in the country. However if the organization is too cooperative, its selection of programs may not be credible or effective as the NGO kowtows to the dictator's demands. What, then, explains how INGOs decide to either respond creatively and push back against government restrictions or accede to those regulations?

I use an adaptation of negotiation theory [@Raiffa:1982; @Mayer:2010] to conceptualize this dynamic relationship between dictators and INGOs.[^9] I model the interaction between authoritarian regimes and INGOs in any given issue area (human rights, development, advocacy, etc.) in simple two-dimensional policy space (see @fig:winsets). Each actor has a preference for a certain level of advocacy or service provision, marked as solid circles in the figure (Regime~ideal~ and INGO~ideal~). Regimes set and implement *de jure* policies to prevent INGO programming from going beyond their ideal point (the reserve value or "best alternative to a negotiated agreement" (BATNA) in negotiation theoretic terms), while INGOs will engage in programming that (when possible) fits within the bounds set by the regime. In addition to these ideal points, each actor has a range of flexibility in the implementation of their regulations or programming, shown in the horizontal lines flanking the ideal points (negotiation space in negotiation theory terms). The space where the two preference ranges overlap (the zone of possible agreement (ZOPA) in negotiation theory) determines both the regime's *de facto* level of restrictions and the INGO's actual mix of programming in that country. 

![Programming preferences in two-dimensional policy space](../../Graphics/winsets){#fig:winsets}

An authoritarian regime's INGO regulatory environment comprises two components: (1) formal *de jure* legislation and policies (represented by the ideal point) and (2) *de facto* implementation of those policies (represented by the negotiation space around the ideal point). Regimes will establish a regulatory environment for international civil society that falls along a continuum of restrictiveness, ranging from *tolerance*, or very few legal or actual restrictions on INGO programs, to *expulsion*, or a complete ban of all INGO activities. The larger the ZOPA, the more tolerant the regime will be about international NGOs working in their regimes, and vice versa—when there is no overlap, an INGO will face expulsion.

In turn, and analogous to the regime's regulatory environment, an INGO's response to authoritarian restrictions comprises three components: (1) the organization's normative principles and ideals, represented by the ideal point, (2) the organization's instrumental flexibility in actually implementing those principles, represented by the space around the ideal point, and (3) the alignment of an INGOs programming with regime preferences, represented by the distance between the two parties' ideal points. Parallel to the regime's initial imposition of the regulatory environment, NGOs will respond along a continuum of cooperation, ranging from *compliance*, or tolerance and cooperation with the legal limits imposed by the regime, to *antagonism*, or blatantly and openly resisting those restrictions. INGOs that engage in programming close to the authoritarian regime's preferences will be more compliant with the regulatory environment, while organizations that pursue more contentious programming will be more antagonistic.

![Possible authoritarian regulatory environments and corresponding INGO responses](../../Graphics/working_theory){#fig:working-theory}

The relationship between INGOs and authoritarian regimes is dynamic, as ideal points shift along the spectrum and negotiation spaces expand or contract. @fig:working-theory demonstrates a mix of possible regulatory environments and INGO responses. The Carnegie Moscow Center is an excellent example of compliance and tolerance. In response to the 2012 and 2015 anti-INGO laws, the Center moved away from its ideal preferences, "sacrificing its intellectual independence and analytical rigor," to realign itself more closely with the regime and maintain its presence in the country [@Kirchick:2015]. OSF, on the other hand, is an example of antagonism and expulsion. Rather than soften its stance toward the regime or shift its resources to other less contentious programs within the country, OSF withdrew and has remained a vocal critic of the regime. 

INGOs can also be antagonistic in a tolerant environment. For example, tight networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while some INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012]. Likewise, INGOs can be compliant in an expulsive environment. Though China is currently in the midst of an unprecedented expansion of civil society and has cooperated with dozens of international NGOs, the regime has shuttered several small INGOs that work with seemingly innocuous issues like advocacy for disabled people [@Chin:2015].

# Framework mechanisms

`TODO`: Finish transition to this section…. Also, finish this section in general :)

Two mechanisms factor in to an INGO's decision-making calculus and programming choices, both corresponding to an element of the model of amicable contempt. An organization's core mission, vision, and values are represented by the ideal point in the model. Briefly discuss literature on NGO/nonprofit mission stuff here.

The region surrounding the ideal point represents an organization's reserve of instrumental flexibility. Briefly discuss literature on instrumental stuff, flexibility here. I define flexibility as the INGO's ability to pursue its principled ideals through a range of instrumental strategies. When facing constraints on its mission, INGOs can marshal new resources, collaborate with more partner organizations, request the support of powerful external actors, relocate their programs to other countries, or pursue other strategies to circumvent, mitigate, or otherwise reduce the impact of those constraints. 

The link between an organization's ideals and its resources represents a tension unique to third sector organizations. INGOs must balance their normative principles against the instrumental need of organizational survival. Unlike governments that work toward producing social value (like maximizing national security or promoting general welfare) or like firms that focus on financial performance (like maximizing profits for shareholders), nonprofit organizations face a tradeoff between their social mission and their need for money and must pursue both simultaneously—they must "instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 489]. Dedicating too much time to protecting and expanding flexibility through overhead activities like fundraising, professionalization, marketing can erode public trust in the organization. At the same time, ignoring necessary overhead concerns in favor of pursuing its vision will limit the organization's ability to effectively fund or carry out that mission (see @Moore:2000, 195). 

Even under favorable political circumstances, nonprofit organizations walk a difficult tightrope between the dual pressures of mission and money. This balancing act becomes even more difficult when the institutional and political environments INGOs work in constrict, target, and limit their programming. When governments restrict the allowable space for advocacy, either through formal legislation (i.e. shifting their ideal point further away) or through bureaucratic implementation of laws and regulations (i.e. shrinking the civil society regulatory environment), INGOs encounter pressure to make adjustments to stay in the country.

TODO: Severity of pressure depends on the distance between the ideal points…

With a handful of exceptions, governments are the dominant actors, or first movers, in their relationship with the INGOs they host. Governments set the legal terms and conditions for INGOs to operate in their countries, while INGOs respond and react to the regulatory environment. As shown in previous chapters, autocratic governments are highly concerned with regime stability and longevity, and changes in a country's civil society regulatory environment and in its formal set of laws and regulations are closely tied to shifts in internal, external, and reputational pressures. 

INGOs, in turn, react to changes in the regulatory environment. Organizations must conform with shifting government regulations to some extent to stay in the country, but this does not necessarily entail giving up on their core values or mission. Organizations can draw on their flexibility to maintain their access to the country and protect themselves from government intrusion into or capture of their mission. INGOs are limited by these practical concerns, though—the more flexibility they enjoy, the better they can adapt and the more creative and antagonistic they can potentially be; the less flexibility they have, the less so.

![Goals of government regulation of INGOs](../../Graphics/regulation-purpose-theory){#fig:regulation-purpose-theory}

Government attempts to regulate INGOs will target one of the two elements of an INGO's negotiating position. Some regulations limit access to the country by reducing an organization's flexibility, while others are aimed at pressuring an organization to shift its mission to become more regime compatible. INGOs react accordingly. TODO: explain @fig:regulation-purpose-theory. 

TODO: @tbl:ingo-reactions-summary summarizes …

| Type of government regulation | Purpose of regulation                             | INGO concern                            |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Gatekeeping                   | Control which organizations are allowed in        | Use flexibility to stay in country      |

Table: Goals of government regulation of INGOs and corresponding INGO responses {#tbl:ingo-reactions-summary}

In the remainder of this chapter, I use the results of a global survey of international NGOs to explore and define each element of my theory: (1) core INGO missions, (2) instrumental flexibility, and (3) alignment with regime preferences. I then analyze how organizations rely on instrumental flexibility to (1) maintain their access to restrictive host countries and (2) protect their missions from government attempts to capture the benefits from their programming, connecting observed INGO reactions to the elements of organizational flexibility that allow them to successfully (and unsuccessfully) respond to government regulation. I conclude by discussing how these results support the implications of my hypotheses and theory.

# Data and methods: a global survey of international NGOs

Studying INGOs that work in authoritarian regimes poses a difficult methodological challenge. There is extensive cross-country research on the relationship between authoritarian regimes and *domestic* institutions like civil society [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014; @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a;  @FrantzEzrow:2011], as well as detailed case studies of individual authoritarian regimes [@Blaydes:2011; @Chen:2012; @Weiss:2013; @Teets:2014; @Hildebrandt:2013; @Brownlee:2007], and autocracies in general [@LevitskyWay:2010]. However, beyond newer case study work [@Teets:2014], little research has looked at how authoritarian regimes and *international* nongovernmental institutions interact.

Additionally, there is a dearth of structured data on INGO activities or behavior. These organizations publish a wealth of unstructured data, such as annual reports, budgets, press releases, or calls to advocacy, but few have systematically compiled these data sources into usable datasets. Existing research either relies on event data parsed from large corpora of news reports or highly specific in-depth case studies based on interviews and other unstructured data. Each of these approaches, however, pose methodological challenges. Event data often yields weak or uninteresting results since event data algorithms were originally developed to track wars and interactions between global elites—not NGOs—while case studies tend to be too focused on a handful of prominent organizations, resulting in findings and theories that are likely not very generalizable [@BloodgoodSchmitz:2013; @MitchellSchmitz:2014]. For example, human rights INGO research has thus far been primarily concerned with Amnesty International and other similar organizations, such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), CARE International, or Oxfam [@Stroup:2012; @Wong:2012]. While there is utility in amassing thick descriptions of INGO activities, more must be done. @MitchellSchmitz:2014 argue that INGO case studies need to be combined with large, more representative analyses to better understand the organizations that work on specific issue areas as a whole. To this end, I test my theory of INGO behavior by conducting an online global survey of international NGOs that work in authoritarian regimes.[^10]

**NB**: In the interest of space, and because this is part of my larger dissertation project, the full technical details of the survey are included in an appendix to this paper.

## Respondent overview

Before analyzing INGO experiences with government restrictions, it is helpful to first look at the survey's respondents. The people who filled out the survey were quite familiar with their organizations' work and had an intimate perspective of their organizations' experiences and strategies. More than half of the respondents indicated that they were the executive director, president, secretary general, CEO, or other high-level officer for their organization, and roughly a third were staff members or program officers, with the remainder either public relations officers or receptionists. Responding organizations span the globe and work on a wide variety of issues and policies. The sample of INGOs have their headquarters spread across 93 different countries (see @fig:hq-countries), with roughly two thirds based in either Europe or the Americas, primarily in the US, UK, and Switzerland (see left panel of @fig:work-hq-regions). 

![Countries where INGOs are headquartered](../../Output/figures/3-hq-countries){#fig:hq-countries}

![Regions where INGOs are headquartered vs. regions about which INGOs answered questions](../../Output/figures/3-work-hq-regions){#fig:work-hq-regions}

While comparatively few INGOs are headquartered outside the Global North, these organizations have a worldwide reach.  As described previously, the survey asked respondents to select all the countries they work in and then allowed respondents to answer questions about their work in at least one. Though 20% of responding organizations indicated working only in one other country, the median number of countries was 6, with a mean of 16 (see @fig:countries-per-response in the appendix). In total, INGOs selected 169 different countries and answered questions about their work in 148. The regional distribution of INGO target countries reflects their broader scope and is almost a mirror image of these organizations' home regions—nearly two-thirds of respondents answered questions about their work in Africa and Asia (see right panel of @fig:work-hq-regions), the most underrepresented regions for NGO headquarters. This disparity could reflect the fact that INGOs from the Global South without a clear English-language internet presence were excluded from the sample, but the pattern also corresponds to similar findings in other surveys of global NGOs [@Limoncelli:2016; @HeissKelley:2016; @FootToftCesare:2015], reinforcing the idea that Northern-based NGOs tend to focus their work in the South. Organizations also operate in a variety of political contexts. Unsurprisingly, given the concentration of INGOs in the Global North, the vast majority of respondents (90%) are headquartered in democracies. The countries these organizations work in, though, show more diversity in regime type—a third of respondents (219) answered questions about their work in autocratic regimes.

# Characteristics that drive INGO behavior

## Protection and contentiousness of mission

According to the theory of amicable contempt, the distance between the government's preferences on a given issue and an INGO's core vision for that issue determine how contentious their relationship will be, ranging from cooperative to antagonistic. This distance, in turn, determines how governments regulate and oversee INGO work. Organizational missions and strategies, therefore, are a crucial element in understanding government regulation of INGOs. 

In their landmark study of transnational NGO leadership, @MitchellSchmitz:2014 find that organizations are primarily *driven* by their missions and *constrained* by instrumental concerns, or what I term flexibility. In response to the question "In general, what would you say your organization is trying to accomplish?," only a quarter of transnational NGO leaders in Mitchell and Schmitz's study mentioned fundraising as a core organizational strategy, with the majority emphasizing their advocacy, service delivery, capacity building or research goals. I find a similar trend in my own survey. In response to the same question about organizational goals, no respondents identified their core mission as resource-oriented. Instead, respondents described their core mission both in aspirational terms, including "fighting poverty and holding leaders accountable,"[^11] encouraging "awareness and pro-action towards sustainable development,"[^12] and promoting "democracy and open society" and "governments' respect for the human rights of children";[^13] and through more specific statements, such as "improv[ing] healthcare, specifically neurological services, in the least developed nations,"[^14] or ending "the use of immigration detention around the world."[^15]

Given that INGOs are driven by these core aspirational missions, organizations are highly protective of these missions and work to avoid changing them in the face of instrumental constraints. The vast majority of respondents (X%) identified funding as the primary obstacle to pursuing their mission, in addition to domestic politics, corruption, and conflicts in their host countries, and a lack of capacity and training among their staff and volunteers. These instrumental obstacles shape and limit how well INGOs can pursue their missions, but INGOs do not seem to adjust their missions in response to funding concerns. When organizations make adjustments to enhance access to funds, professionalize staff, or improve instrumental flexibility in general, they do so without modifying their core missions. "The overall goal of the organization should remain the same," explains an anti-human trafficking INGO working in Southeast Asia, while "strategies to achieve that goal should change and grow on a regular basis, in order to adapt to the development of trends and new technologies."[^16] Similarly, a development INGO in the Caribbean identified a need to adjust instrumental strategies while maintaining their core mission: "Our goals are sound, and the way we do our work is effective, but I feel we need to revamp our fundraising strategy."[^17] Protecting the core mission is essential in the face of financial constraints, and organizations will engage in creative adjustments to maintain their values. For instance, a development INGO in Latin America relates that "[f]unding is always an issue, but in the last 5 years we have changed our strategy to work as a consultancy firm (*without losing our values, vision and mission*) so we can achieve our annual budget."[^18]

INGO missions partially define how antagonistic or cooperative the relationship with their host governments can be, which can then impose regulatory obstacles to undertaking those missions. Organizations working on issues that a regime finds favorable and in line with its own preferences will be treated differently than INGOs working on more threatening, less aligned issues, and INGOs that are more antagonistic will face pressure to temper or tame their core strategies to overcome regulations. But what are INGOs working on, and how do their missions influence government regulation? INGOs that responded to the survey tackle a variety of issues (see @fig:issues-worked-on). The top three issues—education, development, and human rights—account for more than 60% of the respondents and reflect the the makeup of the sample of organizations collected in my database. The remaining 40% of organizations focus on topics that reflect other common issues addressed by global civil society, such as public health, environmental advocacy, disaster relief, human trafficking, post-conflict resolution, and cultural promotion. 

![Issues INGOs work on the most, divided by potential contentiousness](../../Output/figures/3-issues-worked-on){#fig:issues-worked-on}

To analyze the favorability of INGO programming to government preferences, I divide the self-reported respondent issues into two levels of potential high or low regime contentiousness based on the compatibility of the issue with the host regime. In her work on democracy assistance NGOs, @Bush:2015 categorizes programs according to their regime compatibility. Activities that are highly regime compatible are those that "the target-country leaders view as unlikely to threaten their imminent survival by causing regime collapse or overthrow," as opposed to non-regime compatible programs that do pose a more imminent threat [@Bush:2015, 60]. My definition of contentiousness is broader than Bush's—while Bush looks at the immediate threat of democracy promotion programs, I look at how regimes view NGO programming in the long run and how those activities fit into authoritarian calculations of stability. As seen in @fig:issues-worked-on, highly contentious issues include human rights, advocacy, human trafficking, freedom of expression, conflict, and democracy assistance—all issues that pose a direct threat to autocratic policies and stability. Less contentious issues like education, development, health, and the environment reflect policy areas where governments are more willing to accept intervention and assistance. More importantly, highly contentious programs are more difficult to capture and take advantage of—it is easier for a repressive government to improve its domestic reputation and offset institutional challenges to its political stability by permitting disaster relief organizations or funding community sport organizations than inviting a human rights NGO that is critical of government repression.

![Frequency of INGO engagement in different types of activities; organizations answered about one or more activities](../../Output/figures/3-main-activities){#fig:main-activities}

This division of INGOs into contentious and non contentious programming aligns well with the activities INGOs report engaging in. @fig:main-activities shows how frequently responding organizations work on a variety of types of programming.[^19] If the division of contentiousness is correct, low contention INGOs should provide direct aid and services and engage in research and public education most frequently, since these types of programming pose little threat to the target country regime. High contention INGOs, on the other hand, should deal most often with more threatening activities like advocacy, political mobilization, and government monitoring. As seen in the figure, 60% of low contention organizations indicated they almost always provide aid, half almost always engage in research, and less than 40% monitor the government or mobilize people. Interestingly, about half of low contention organizations reported regularly engaging in advocacy. However, this form of advocacy appears to still be noncontentious: respondents describe advocating for "expanded public health programs,"[^20] "agr[i]culture,"[^21] "volunteerism,"[^22] "girls completing secondary education,"[^23] or expanding "access [to] health and justice."[^24] 

As expected, high contention organizations are most likely to report always engaging in advocacy (63%) and monitoring government policies (53%), including advocating for the recognition and safety of human rights defenders,[^25]assisting with the "rehabilitation of repentant terrorists,"[^26] promoting religious freedom and human rights, [^27] and "holding … leaders accountable" for their policies and actions.[^28] These more contentious organizations engage in research and public education as the third most common primary activity (53%). These educational activities clearly post more of a threat to the government and are more focused on human rights, such as maintaining a death penalty policy database,[^29] organizing activist training sessions and hackathons,[^30] or developing country-specific media literacy training programs.[^31] These organizations only sometimes provide direct aid and services, in contrast to their low contention counterparts. Finally, both kinds of INGOS are least likely to report always engaging in political mobilization, which is understandable for low contention organizations but surprising for those working on more contentious issues. INGOs may have conflated this kind of work with engaging in research—organizations mentioned political mobilization and campaigns in many of their explanations of their research and public education work.

This categorization is by no means perfect. As seen in the case of China in the previous chapter, education INGOs can pose a threat to regime stability as governments fear the spread of foreign influence among their youth, and development INGOs can rival weak central governments and create territorial "fiefdoms" to supersede the regime [@Schuller:2012]. However, while the division between low and high contention issues is fairly simplistic, it does appear to accurately capture (1) the broad types of programs that INGOs engage in, and (2) the range of possible objections governments are likely to raise (or not raise).

Though a substantial number of organizations engage in contentious programming, in general, INGOs have a fairly positive relationship with their host governments (@fig:govt-positivity-both), since maintaining some level of government tolerance is essential to staying in the country. Only 10% of respondents report having a somewhat or extremely negative relationship with their host governments, while the remainder either have a positive relationship or are ambivalent.[^32] Opinions of the positivity of this relationship depend on the type of government and the contentiousness of the INGO's issue. 60% of INGOs that reported a negative relationship work in autocracies, while only 20–30% with a positive or ambivalent relationship work in similar regimes.[^33] Similarly, 50% of organizations with a negative relationship work on contentious issues. In fact, 17% of high contention INGOs have a negative relationship with their hosts, in contrast to only 8% of low contention organizations.[^34]
 
![Opinions of relationship with host government, separated by regime type and issue contentiousness (cell heights represent proportion of responses; cell widths represent proportion of organizations working in regime type or on issue)](../../Output/figures/3-govt-positivity-both){#fig:govt-positivity-both}

This trend towards highly contentious INGOs working in authoritarian regimes having a more negative relationship with the regime reflects respondent experiences. Organizations working on low contention issues that align with government needs report having a close and cordial working relationship with their hosts. A health organization working in West Africa explains that "[w]e work very closely with government hospitals and universities, [and we meet with] various health ministers [regularly],"[^35]and a development organization working in Central America reports that "[w]e work very closely with the trade unions, many of whom have representatives in the National Assembly," and that they have a good relationship with the host government's foreign ministry and with their ambassador in the organization's home country.[^36] Government officials are often enthusiastic about NGO work and sometimes "verbally express their gratitude to work with" foreign NGOs.[^37] One education INGO working in a South Asian dictatorship summarizes the experiences of many low-contention organizations optimistically: "We really do not have any problem with them, mater [sic] of fact they work with us so well that when we need any kind of help they are there for us to assist. We have a great relationship."[^38]

Not all organizations enjoy such a warm relationship with the government. Some low contention organizations have poor relationships with their host governments because of poor governance, with one disaster relief INGO working in Southeast Asia reporting that "There is a lot of bureaucracy and corruption. We spend so much time to get approval in the projects. We don't agree to pay bribe, which makes or work even more difficult."[^39] More commonly, though, INGOs working on contentious issues have negative relationships with their target governments since government activities are often the raison d'être for contentious programming. A human rights INGO in Latin America notes dryly, "most typically, [governments] are the driving force of the human rights abuse we document."[^40] An organization working in Central Africa also identifies their programming as the source of this poor relationship:

> we document and report human rights violation, we organise presse conference to denounce and alert the peoples on pertinent cases, the government is against this and task us to be instrumantalised by europeans and americans, we undergo threats of all forms and some times watch our meetings monitored. [sic][^41]

This organization's mission to report on human rights violations makes its relationship with the government naturally combative, and the government responds by conflating INGO programming with former imperial influence and by closely following the organization's activities. The link between contentious programming and poor relationships is reiterated by other human rights INGOs working in Oceania and the Middle East:

> We are highly critical of them and their policies and laws. We are human rights defenders at risk of prosecution for our work in sharing information with the UN human rights mechanisms. We are monitored by the security agency.[^42]

> The government does not want us to document violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including systematic torture and abuse of civilians, civil society activists and women rights defenders.[^43]

**TODO**: Something conclusionary here.

## Instrumental flexibility

Recall from @fig:govt-positivity-both that the majority of INGOs maintain a positive relationship with their host countries. This is the "amicable" side of the theory of amicable contempt—organizations can help guarantee their access to the country by acting friendly towards the regime, even if their programming confronts the regime. But the need for amicability does not mean that organizations must give up on their core vision and mission and tame their programs to completely match their host governments' preferences, nor does it entail that governments will always be friendly to the INGOs they allow in: half of organizations with negative host-country relationships work on contentious issues, but by extension, half of the INGOs at odds with the government engage in less contentious programming. The ability of INGOs to remain in their host countries, avoid restrictions, and maintain positive relationships with the government does not depend entirely on ideal preferences. Both actors can emphasize the "contempt" half of amicable contempt by making changes to the space around their ideal points. 

Governments will tolerate guest INGOs as long as there is some overlap in the negotiation space around the two actors' ideal points, or as long as (1) the government's civil society regulatory environment allows for some level of advocacy or service provision beyond the ideal point, and (2) the INGO has enough flexibility to change and adapt its programs to comply with the regulatory environment. Regimes can constrict the allowable space for INGO activity by restricting the civil society regulatory environment, while organizations can respond by relying on their instrumental flexibility to make marginal adjustments to their non-core programming. The more flexibility and INGO has,  the better they can adapt and the more creative and antagonistic they can potentially be; the less flexibility they have, the less so. This instrumental flexibility can take many forms, including organization size, funding sources, knowledge of the host country, and patterns of collaboration, and INGO responses to different forms of government restriction and regulation are determined in part by how much flexibility organizations can draw on.

Most of the organizations that responded tend to be small, with half employing eight or fewer staff members. This does not mean, however, that the INGO sector as a whole employs few people—because of dozens of large organizations with hundreds (and even thousands) of employees, the average staff size is 50. These larger, better staffed organizations inherently need to have access to more financial resources to pay their employees, which can weigh NGOs down with fundraising concerns. At the same time, having more employees provides these larger organizations with more flexibility in the face of restrictions—if an organization is limited in one country, it can more easily shift programs and staff around to work in other countries or on other topics. In addition to full time staff, the majority of INGOs (93%) rely on volunteers to help implement their missions and programs. Half of responding INGOs use 25 or fewer employees, and the average (290) is again inflated by large, well funded INGOs that can afford to train, equip, and manage many more volunteers. Notably, 20% of responding organizations employ no formal staff and instead rely completely on volunteers. Having no employees does not necessarily entail an exact substitution of paid staff for unpaid volunteers—organizations with no staff tend to use fewer volunteers (median = 20, mean = 242) than their staffed counterparts, likely because managing volunteers imposes costs on organizations.

![Level of reliance on sources of funding, divided by organization size](../../Output/figures/3-funding-size){#fig:funding-size}

Variation in funding sources also helps determine an organization's flexibility. Government grants—from host countries, target countries, and other donors countries—are the most common stream of income reported by respondents, followed by individual donations, grants from NGOs and foundations, and corporate giving (see left panel of @fig:funding-size). Additionally, dozens of respondents report generating their own income through fundraising efforts, member fees, consulting services, and unrelated business income. The size of the organization is related to the funding sources it relies on. Organizations that employ more than 50 people selected an average of 4 streams of funding, while smaller organizations reported an average of 3. The mix and selection of funding sources can also depend on organization size (see right panel of @fig:funding-size). Smaller organizations are most likely to rely primarily on fundraising, member fees, and individual donations, and less heavily on grants from NGOs, foundations, and corporations. Additionally, nearly two thirds of smaller organizations explicitly eschew government funding, relying instead on other sources of revenue. Larger organizations also rely on fundraising, individual donations, and foundation grants, but are also far more likely than their smaller counterparts to draw money from governments, IGOs, and corporations. Larger INGOs tend to juggle more revenue streams to support their additional staff and programming, and these organizations are more likely to rely on government funding, which can come with more conditions and strings attached than private donations. With this diversification in income sources comes flexibility—if an organization fails to obtain a government grant, it can turn to foundations, fundraising, or other sources to compensate. Organizations with more sources of funding are thus likely more flexible when facing restrictions on their programs abroad.

![Frequency of collaboration, divided by organization size](../../Output/figures/3-collaboration-size){#fig:collaboration-size}

INGOs can also find flexibility in collaborative relationships. Organizations that work in isolation can find it difficult to make adjustments or offload programs and work when facing restrictions and limitations on their work, while those that work closely with other organizations can benefit from their expertise, support, and social networks. Most organizations indicate collaborating with at least one other actor; only nineteen respondents explicitly stated that they do not collaborate at all. INGOs tend to collaborate most frequently with other NGOs, followed by IGOs, governments, and corporations (@fig:collaboration-size). As with funding, organization size is associated with patterns of collaboration. Smaller organizations are more likely to collaborate with NGOs, while larger INGOs collaborate more frequently with governments and corporations, mirroring patterns in funding sources seen previously.

![Length of time in host country, divided by regime type](../../Output/figures/3-time-country){#fig:time-country}

A final source of operational flexibility is the familiarity an organization has with the country it targets. INGOs that have a longer presence in a country tend to have deeper institutional knowledge of that country and can better navigate the bureaucracy and work with local officials and NGOs. Responding organizations vary in how long they have been active in the countries they answered about (see @fig:time-country). Organizations working in democracies are most likely to have been in those countries for more than a decade, while those working in autocracies are equally likely to either be newer entrants (with a presence of 1–4 years) or have a more longstanding presence. 

![In-country operational strategies; multiple answers allowed](../../Output/figures/3-operations){#fig:operations}

The amount of flexibility an organization enjoys influences the variety of programs and strategies it is able to implement. For instance, @fig:operations shows the frequency responding organizations engage in four broad types of operations: funding local NGOs, partnering directly with local NGOs, maintaining an office staffed by locals, and maintaining an office staffed by foreigners. Most respondents partner with domestic NGOs and maintain locally-staffed countries when possible. Organizations with more flexibility, however, selected more strategies. On average, employing more employees, drawing from more funding sources, and collaborating with more partners are each associated with a greater number of operational strategies.[^44] Better funded, staffed, and cooperative INGOs can afford to staff offices in multiple countries and fund and partner with local organizations. 

**TODO**: Something conclusionary here.

# INGOs and government regulations

TODO: Write this ¶. Governments are first movers in the relationship and set the regulatory environment for INGOs, so INGOs have to keep up with and respond to changes in the regulatory environment. Not all changes are bad, though. When they are bad, INGOs respond accordingly.

Because governments set the initial conditions for operating, being aware of the regulatory environment is crucial for INGOs to maintain legal status their host countries. INGOs tend to be quite aware of the regulatory environment of their host countries, with more than 80% of respondents somewhat or very familiar with the laws regulating their activities (see @fig:familiarity-both).[^45] Familiarity is affected by the type of regime organizations work in. More than 75% of respondents who answered that they do not know anything about regulations work in democracies, while those most familiar with the regulatory environment are split roughly equally between democracies and autocracies.[^46] INGOs working in dictatorships are the most likely to be the most familiar with regulations, likely because deep knowledge of the legal environment is more essential to operate safely and effectively. The contentiousness of the issues INGOs work on does not help determine their familiarity—high contention INGOs are not more or less likely to be more aware of the legal environment.[^47]

![Knowledge of regulatory environment in host government, separated by regime type and issue contentiousness (cell heights represent proportion of responses; cell widths represent proportion of organizations working in regime type or on issue)](../../Output/figures/3-familiarity-both){#fig:familiarity-both}

INGOs report that regulations can change frequently—half of respondents report that regulations and laws change every few years, and nearly 20% say regulations change at least once a year (see @fig:frequency).[^48] The regime type of the host country is closely related to how frequently INGOs see changes in regulations. Nearly two thirds of the INGOs that report changes at least once a year work in autocracies, which contrasts starkly with the two thirds of INGOs that experience a static legal environment in democratic host countries.[^49] 

![Frequency of changes in regulatory environment for NGOs in host country, separated by regime type (cell heights represent proportion of responses; cell widths represent proportion of organizations working in regime type)](../../Output/figures/3-frequency){#fig:frequency}

Given their frequency, the regulatory changes INGOs observe do not necessarily correlate with formal statutory developments. For instance, as seen in previous chapters, Egypt has only formally passed civil society laws in 2002 and 2012. These laws give bureaucrats and politicians significant interpretive leeway, however, and allow them to reshape the regulatory environment for international NGOs. Because of this dynamic discretionary de facto environment, INGOs actively seek out information about changes in laws, rules, and regulations (see @fig:change-how-find-out). International NGOs are most likely to hear about new legal changes from other NGOs in the country, both from their local partners and from other foreign organizations. They also receive news about changes directly from government officials, sometimes at inopportune moments. One INGO working in East Africa, unaware of any changes in regulations, discovered new funding requirements for foreign NGOs when requesting permits to expand their operations in the country—the organization ultimately decided to not expand as a result.[^50] INGOs also find out about changes in laws through the media and through internet research, including websites that aggregate information about civil society regulations like Civicus and the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law (ICNL). The fact that INGOs tend to seek out the latest information about their regulatory environment shows that these organizations are active participants in their relationship with their host governments, regularly measuring and testing the acceptable boundaries for their work. 

![Channels of discovering changes in the regulatory environment for NGOs in host country](../../Output/figures/3-change-how-find-out){#fig:change-how-find-out}

Not all changes in NGO laws lead to restrictions on activities, however. In work with Suparna Chaudhry, I find that  the global increase in NGO laws is partly attributable to the routinization of NGO-government relations [@ChaudhryHeiss:2017; see also @BloodgoodTremblay-Boire:2016]. For example, governments may require NGO registration in an attempt to formally define their relationship with civil society, and those registration laws will not necessarily be burdensome. Data from @ChristensenWeinstein:2013 helps demonstrate this difference in restrictiveness. @fig:djcw-reg-regime shows the prevalence of NGO registration laws in 98 countries from 1990–2013. Roughly the same proportion of autocracies and democracies require that NGOs register, and both types of countries have increased this type of legislation at similar rates over time. However, far more autocracies make these registration laws burdensome, at a much faster rate. This suggests that there is an imperative to regularize state-NGO relations around the world, implying that the changes in laws that INGO respondents observe are not necessarily harmful. At the same time, there is a move to increase the burden of these more benign laws in autocracies, making it more difficult for NGOs to operate in these contexts.

![Proportion of countries with laws that require NGO registration and that impose additional burdens on the registration process, by regime type [@ChristensenWeinstein:2013]](../../Output/figures/3-dcjw-reg-regime){#fig:djcw-reg-regime}

Survey respondents confirm this. Nearly two-thirds of INGOs feel the most restricted and constrained by government regulations work in autocracies, compared to 25% of organizations that report facing no restrictions in similar regimes (see @fig:restriction-both).[^51] The relationship between host country regime type and feelings of restriction is quite marked, with the proportion of respondents working in autocracies decreasing steadily as the feeling of restriction decreases. Interestingly, there is not as clear of a relationship between the contentiousness of INGO programming and feelings of restriction. Half of highly restricted organizations work on contentious issues, but there is no significant difference between the other levels of restriction—roughly 25% of organizations answering each other level of restriction work have contentious programming. It thus appears that the findings in @fig:djcw-reg-regime hold true—governments are increasingly passing routine NGO laws, but those laws are far more burdensome in autocracies, where they are designed to restrict NGO activities.

# Limiting INGO flexibility through gatekeeping

Regulations that *are* designed to be burdensome target both elements of an INGO's organizational preferences (see @tbl:ingo-reactions-summary). INGOs confront each of these types of regulation by drawing on their flexibility to either (1) maintain access to the country, or (2) protect against changes to their missions. 

TODO: A couple paragraphs outlining:

- Theoretical form of regulation (see gatekeeping part of @fig:regulation-purpose-theory): Host governments constrict the civil society regulatory environment in order to limit organizational flexibility and control which INGOs are allowed in the country
- Effects on INGOs: Laws slow things down, make life difficult, filter out the most contentious; limit funding, decrease efficacy of programs
- Expected INGO reactions: When relationship is not contentious, organizations will maintain good relationship with the government, follow registration laws, keep within government limits. When relationship is more contentious, organizations will find ways around registration, avoid fees, outsource regulations, work regardless of registration status, work in exile, create smaller programs, fund irregularly, channel funds through domestic partners, etc.
- Organizations with most resources and flexibility are best able to deal with changes


## Why limit flexibility?

TODO: Finish this ¶: governments want to limit foreign influence, mitigate political risks

In chapter two, I argued that authoritarian regimes see international NGOs as an institutional threat to regime stability. Respondent experiences reinforce this finding, reflecting how many authoritarian host governments clearly see foreign NGOs as dangers. Respondents note that their relationship with the government is often affected by the political atmosphere[^52] and that international NGOs in particular are seen as risky political actors.[^53] Some NGOs feel that accusations of acting as foreign political operatives are baseless and note that there is "much hue and cry about foreign money and agenda with out any evidence."[^54]

The foreign provenance of international NGOs appears to be the overriding trigger of fears for stability, most likely because it is more difficult to directly regulate or control non-domestic organizations. A conflict resolution INGO working in East Africa argues that it is difficult to work with the host government because "any organization or investor from […] another country is viewed as a threat to the government of [the country], especially on issues resolving conflicts and human right[s]."[^55] Governments are especially wary of foreign organizations that work directly with citizens—for instance, one human rights INGO in East Africa feels like the government considers it a threat to national security when staff conduct trainings in the community.[^56] Fears of foreign influence are not limited solely to contentious organizations. An education INGO working in Southern Africa reports government suspicion of their pro-education advocacy and training, noting that "[t]he government is security and politically conscious, and have a negative view to gatherings of people. They take gatherings as opportunities for political influence."[^57]

![Severity of gatekeeping regulations, divided by contentiousness](../../Output/figures/3-regs-faced-gatekeeping){#fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping}

TODO: Short ¶ outlining the rest of this section—gatekeeping regulations target entry, programs, and resources

## Entry gatekeeping: registration

Registration is the form of regulation most clearly linked to goals of gatekeeping, and is one of the most common forms of government regulation of NGO activities—as seen in @fig:djcw-reg-regime, more than half of countries require that NGOs register with a government agency. NGO experiences with registration, however, are mixed. More than two-thirds of responding organizations report feeling moderately or substantially affected by registration laws (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping), and organizations working on contentious issues are more likely to face substantial restrictions. However, feelings of restriction and actual registration are not necessarily linked—roughly half of respondents are *not* formally registered in their host countries (see top panel of @fig:registration-all), and there is no significant difference between the registration status of INGOs working either in autocratic regimes or working on contentious issues. Registration status is correlated, however, with organizations' overall perceptions of restriction (see bottom panel of @fig:registration-all). In both types of regimes, organizations that report not feeling restricted are the most likely to not be registered, while those that feel moderately restricted are the least likely to register. In the absence of strict registration laws, many INGOs can fly under the radar and avoid formal registration. For example, a development INGO in Latin America reports "We're not registered… we just 'do our own thing'; so far the government has paid no attention to us in any way."[^58] As governments increase their enforcement of registration laws, INGOs feel more restricted and are more likely to be registered. However, the relationship between registration status and perceptions of restriction diverges for the most restricted INGOs. Organizations that report feeling the most restricted are just as likely to be registered as their unrestricted (and largely unregistered) counterparts, generally because it is exceptionally difficult and costly to formally register. 

![**Top**: Self-reported registration status in host country, separated by regime type and issue contentiousness; **Bottom**: Self-reported registration status in host country, separated simultaneously by feeling of restriction and regime type (cell heights represent proportion of responses; cell widths represent proportion of organizations working in regime type or on issue)](../../Output/figures/3-registration-all){#fig:registration-all}

The experiences of responding NGOs reveals much about the effects of registration requirements on programming decisions. Organizations working in democratic contexts generally face little trouble in registering, noting that the process tends require "just some formalities… [and] administrative work" such as submission of annual reports, board minutes, and basic financial statements to government authorities, which does not ultimately have any negative impact on their daily work.[^59] Those working in more difficult political environments shared differing experiences. Common complaints about registration dealt with its duration, cost, and arbitrary process. Organizations explain that "it takes a large number of steps to become registered [and] rules are not clearly articulated."[^60] INGOs working in highly autocratic countries like Cameroon, Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, and Nigeria report registration processes that take 3–7 years to complete, days of travel to government offices in capital cities, and thousands of dollars in fees and side payments.[^61]  Others also face arbitrary registration requirements invented by local officials, saying that "conditions have been added randomly on our NGO without any basis."[^62] In some countries, international organizations face a double registration requirement—an education INGO working in Latin America spent several years obtaining registration status only to discover that even with formal registration, they had to incorporate a domestic NGO to gain legal personhood and access to the banking system and courts, a process which took another four years.[^63] The bureaucratic bottlenecks do not stop after this initial registration—a religious humanitarian services INGO working in the Caribbean spends at least three months every year working to secure annual renewal of that status, which imposes substantial administrative costs and causes delays in importing food and medical supplies.[^64]

When facing gatekeeping restrictions like registration laws, INGOs use their instrumental flexibility to make marginal adjustments to their programming to maintain overlap with regime preferences. Often, no adjustment is needed—most low contention organizations already overlap with regime preferences and willingly comply with registration regulations without issues. One development INGO working in East Africa represents the experiences of many other organizations, reporting that "because [our organization] is supported and invited by the […] governments themselves, we do not have problems with the ability to pursue missions. Being invited means that we are welcome to operate and pursue each mission," and because of their clear overlap with government preferences, they are "in complete compliance … with these rules and regulations without falter."[^65]   

When the distance between regime and ideal points is more distant and the relationship more antagonistic, INGOs use their flexibility and resources to act more creatively. Some organizations, for instance, seek out the friendliest and most amenable bureaucrats when registering or communicating with the government. A development INGO working in Oceania that was struggling to obtain permission to work in the country and import aid supplies stopped approaching ministry-level officials after repeated failure. Instead, they turned to local bureaucrats, who in turn obtained permission from their respective ministry heads.[^66] This workaround depends on the organization's instrumental flexibility, though, and is only possible with some knowledge of intragovernmental relationships—the INGO had to cultivate and understand those relationships over time in order to take advantage of them to expedite registration. 

More often, rather than creatively navigate the bureaucracy, organizations actively limit their contact with the government. It is important to note that this active avoidance of the government is different from the experiences of INGOs that are allowed to "do [their] own thing." In those cases, the preferences for both the government and INGO overlap and governments see no need to require registration or regular contact. In contrast, INGOs react with active avoidance when the government pulls back the civil society regulatory environment in an effort to control INGO activity. INGOs must wield and extend their flexibility to cope with this shift. Organizations will "avoid any contact with government officials"[^67] and work carefully to "reduce our visibility"[^68] in circumstances where registration and other gatekeeping rules are too restrictive, and exceptionally strict regulations can drive INGOs underground and severely inhibit their ability to carry out their mission. 

Sometimes INGOs change their headquarters within their host countries in response to increased government scrutiny. One organization working in Southeast Asia moved its headquarters to a more remote part of the country after local authorities became aware that they were not fully compliant with all regulations, while others working in Eastern Europe and Central Asia relocated to avoid uncooperative and "not ethical" officials who decided that the INGOs were not compliant.[^69] Finally, some organizations—particularly those with more contentious mission—move out of the country completely and work in exile because of the arbitrary (and targeted) enforcement of registration requirements.[^70]  

INGOs require sufficient resources and flexibility to engage in these strategies of active avoidance. Moving headquarters is expensive and time-consuming, and the organizations that report doing so tend to have more streams of revenue, employees, staff, or collaborative relationships than the average respondent. An organization working in the Middle East illustrates the importance of having increased flexibility to deal with registration restrictions.[^71] The INGO provides humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war and their host government is hostile towards them. The organization reports that "they do not want us to operate there" and that registration is difficult. As a result, the INGO actively avoids any contact with government officials and flies under the radar as much as possible. Though hiding from the government puts the organization at risk for expulsion and forecloses officially sanctioned streams of revenue from government ministries, the organization is able to sustain itself legally and financially through connections to other larger IGOs and INGOs like the World Food Programme, the Red Crescent, and large American churches, which provide the INGO with substantial funding and legal support.

In contrast, a humanitarian aid INGO working in the Caribbean provides an example of how low instrumental flexibility limits organizational effectiveness under strict registration regulations.[^72] The respondent explains that the organization is out of compliance with most gatekeeping laws, but that "in principle, I don't like being out of compliance." The organization is not officially registered with the government, which leads to difficult legal consequences. The respondent says:

> It is a very complex and lengthy process to register a foreign organization. It cost over $10,000 and many, many trips into the capital to complete. It meant that for our first 7 years of operation, we were not an official organization and could not purchase property or vehicles in the org's name.

In the absence of legal standing and access to the courts or property registration system, the organization keeps its programming hidden as much as possible and even avoids putting logos on their vehicles or advertising their work to the public. While the organization is able to fulfill its mission of improving health in rural communities, it feels held back by its precarious legal situation and is unable to scale up, fearing the legal ramifications that could follow "if we grow big enough where we can no longer fly under the radar." The respondent identifies low funding as the primary barrier to both emerging from the regulatory shadows and to scaling up its operations. With more opportunities for fundraising and grant writing, the organization would be able to register and find firmer legal standing, but the absence of these resources "is holding back growth." The organization has not shifted its core mission to become more friendly to the regime, but its lack of flexibility has relegated it to the margins.

Thus, because these laws are aimed at controlling access to the country, INGOs facing registration restrictions strive to maintain their access. INGOs that have a more cooperative relationship with their host governments generally do not face difficulties complying with these regulations. When the relationship is more antagonistic, INGOs react to stricter registration regulations by drawing on their instrumental flexibility to creatively confront the rules or avoid the government entirely, all in the hope of avoiding shifting their core missions.

## Program gatekeeping: assembly and speech

Registration laws are not the only mechanism for controlling INGOs. Once organizations are allowed in, governments can use laws that restrict freedom of assembly and speech to exercise gatekeeping power over the types of programs that are permitted. This allows governments to limit potential risks of foreign influence that could stem from INGO programming. Laws restricting assembly and speech are typically designed to prevent mass political and social protests, but these laws also affect many NGO programs. One INGO working in Southern Africa explains that "the government is security and politically conscious, and have a negative view to gatherings of people. They take gatherings as opportunities for political influence. … The government associates international NGOs with politics which is not entirely true."[^73] Organizations engaged in more contentious advocacy are especially prone to enhanced government scrutiny and fears of political influence. The majority of respondents who reported substantial or moderate difficulties with limits on assembly and speech work on contentious issues (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping), but noncontentious organizations also get caught up in these additional restrictions. An organization in South Asia providing disaster relief downplayed government fears of the potential political influence of NGOs, condemning its host government's "hue and cry about foreign money and agenda with out any evidence."[^74]

The potentially political nature of INGO programming leads to stricter limitations on assembly. In a few highly repressive cases, there is a ban on all meetings, rallies, and protests,[^75] but such prohibitions are rare. Instead, respondents report that bureaucrats set the terms for the gatherings and grant or deny permission to meet. In most authoritarian countries, NGOs need police or government clearance to hold any public gathering or assembly.[^76] Activities must be pre-planned and be demonstrably well organized, and even if all rules and regulations are followed, applications and permits can be denied or revoked arbitrarily and without explanation.[^77]INGOs also face restrictions on speech—a media development organization working in Eastern Africa has to receive ministry approval for all their scripts and training materials[^78]Even with permission to engage in speech or advocacy, there are still substantial risks: one human rights advocacy INGO working in Southeast Asia reported that ten of its members were arrested and imprisoned because they had participated in a peaceful political protest.[^79] 

How do INGOs react to and accommodate these restrictions? Again, because INGOs facing gatekeeping restrictions are most concerned with maintaining access to the country, organizations confront restrictions on assembly and speech by drawing on their instrumental resources and flexibility. However, unlike registration laws, which many organizations are able to skirt by flying under the radar and avoiding contact with the government, hiding more public activities like workshops, meetings, and rallies imposes heavier costs on organizations and carries a higher risk of punishment for noncompliance. As such, the majority of respondents lack the ability or will to marshal resources to challenge these laws and instead tend to comply with speech and assembly regulations and will make their political neutrality quite public.

Organizations whose core missions do not involve large gatherings and protests actively eschew the appearance of politics: a human trafficking organization working in Southeast Asia noted that they "do not have problems with freedom to assembly since we are not engage in leftist activities,"[^80] while a children's INGO in Eastern Europe sidesteps restrictions through the "simple use of discretion (avoid politically motivated gatherings) [sic]."[^81] Respondents also engage in frequent self-censorship to signal their benign intentions to their host regimes. Organizations are aware of "unwritten limitations to how much [their] advocacy work can go" and fear being seen as anti-regime, since crossing unstated government red lines encourages "government operatives [to] start looking for trivial faults as [a] way [of] shutting us up."[^82] Most INGOs "take care not to cross" these lines and pay careful attention to the phrasing of their public statements, avoiding any overt criticism of their host countries.[^83]

Similarly, organizations that are inherently more contentious, that cannot avoid the appearance of politics, or that offer public activities involving many participants maintain access to the country primarily by following regulations regarding speech and assembly. Even many of the most contentious human rights INGOs attempt to obtain permits and official permission for their public-facing programming. For instance, in response to the arrests of its members and because of its inability to formally register in the country, the human rights INGO working in Southeast Asia changed how it trains its partners within that country and now communicates with activists online through Facebook Messenger and Skype.[^84] Other organizations make marginal adjustments to their programming to adhere to assembly laws without actually changing the core purpose of that programming. One organization implements its mission of teaching peace building and interfaith cooperation in countries facing religious and ethnic conflict by holding large-scale public events and workshops with thousands of attendees. Because speech and assembly laws in one of the Southeast Asian countries the INGO targets prohibit such events, though, the organization breaks these workshops into smaller, more frequent events, working with "hundreds, not thousands" at a time.[^85] 

INGOs are able to make these adjustments only when they have sufficient flexibility to do so. The human rights INGO in Southeast Asia works closely with European politicians and UN diplomats and has access to lawyers that can bring human rights abuse cases to local, European, and international courts. It also has to technology and can help domestic activists access the internet safely, allowing for secure remote trainings and workshops. Similarly, the peace building INGO in Southeast Asia has sufficient money, time, and staff to host many small events in part because of its many collaborative relationships with several IGOs and large Western foundations. Without these resources, these organizations would likely not confront or adapt to the restrictions on assembly and speech and would struggle to maintain their access to their respective target countries. 

Thus, as with registration restrictions, INGOs facing assembly and speech restrictions are concerned primarily with maintaining access to the country. Confronting these laws, however, is more costly and risky and not always necessary. When their core mission does not entail a political threat to the government, INGOs react by engaging in self-censorship or publicly demonstrating their political neutrality. When INGO programs are inherently political or are directly threatened by these regulations, organizations rely on their instrumental flexibility to avoid changing to their core missions.

## Resource gatekeeping: funding and resources

Finally, governments use legislation and regulations to control organizational resources, again with the intent of limiting the political influence of outside actors in domestic politics. Resource-focused restrictions are as common as restrictions on registration—only a third of responding organizations report not feeling any effects of resource-related laws (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping). By regulating and limiting access to funds, governments are able to directly target a crucial element of instrumental flexibility.

Government attempts to take advantage of INGO programming fall into two general categories. First, governments can directly capture resources by imposing additional taxes and fees for INGO activities or by demanding bribes for continued access. 


# Encouraging shifts in INGO missions through program capture

TODO: A couple paragraphs outlining:

- Theoretical form of regulation (see capture part of @fig:regulation-purpose-theory): Host governments constrict the civil society regulatory environment in an effort to target INGO missions and capture the benefits from their work or coerce INGO missions to be more amenable to regime preferences
- Effects on INGOs: Laws lock INGOs into their programs, change their missions; make them pawns in greater political game within country
- Expected INGO reactions: When relationship is not contentious and/or when flexibility is limited, organizations will be more likely to align their missions with the government and explicitly shape their programs to match government objectives. When relationship is more contentious, organizations will act more strategically to protect against changes: choosing regulatory body, using more/fewer local/foreign staff, moving to a different country
- Organizations with most resources and flexibility are best able to deal with changes

## Why capture programs?

Though fears of regime stability appear paramount in determining the relationship between INGOs and governments, the relationship between INGOs and their host governments is not always so antagonistic. Governments often take advantage of the foreign organizations working in their countries, using their presence and their services to boost their own public image at home and abroad. The presence of foreign organizations in failed states can signal growing stability and instill confidence in potential investors. For example, an education INGO working in East Africa reports:

> The [g]overnment is desperately seeking any form of cooperation with foreign countries to re-establish a resemblance of normality in a war-ravaged country that is slowly trying to lift off. Therefore any international action is warmly welcomed by top brass executives of any political side.[^86]

The presence of foreign NGOs can also act as a signal of compliance with international norms to domestic audiences. INGOs provide specialized services and expertise that are often not offered by domestic firms or local governments. Government ministries tend to partner with INGOs "whenever they need… services"[^87] to take advantage of improved services and to access better resources. One disaster relief INGO working in South Asia reports having a close and productive relationship with the government, since it "has recognized how quickly and efficiently our nonprofit was able to provide relief services and has supported partnerships with us in many areas related to our programs of health, education and [disaster] recovery."[^88] Government officials will also use foreign NGO services and expertise for personal political gain—a public health INGO working in West Africa notes that "some state officials want your services to be in their home villages and community"[^89] as a form of pork barrel politics, securing aid and services for their constituents, while an education INGO reports that the Latin American government they work with generally ignores them, except during elections, when "politicians will visit the partner we work with for photo ops."[^90]

TODO: Short ¶ outlining the rest of this section—governments attempt program capture with regulations related to oversight and operations.

## Oversight

Governments are can be closely—and sometimes directly—involved in INGO programming, particularly in authoritarian contexts. The left panel of @fig:freq-both shows that organizations working in both types of regimes tend to be in fairly regular contact with the government, with the majority of INGOs meeting with officials at some level of government at least once a year. This diverges from how often INGOs claim to be required to submit formal reports to the government in the right panel of @fig:freq-both. The majority of organizations working in democracies—roughly 40% of all respondents—do not have any official reporting requirements, while a little over 15% of organizations working in democracies are required to report annually. In contrast, organizations that target autocracies are far less likely to not need to report, generally must check in at least annually with the government, and are more likely to need to report more than once a year. Autocracies thus have a heavier hand in INGO affairs, requiring more formal reporting and oversight than their democratic counterparts.

![Frequency of contact with government and formal reporting to government](../../Output/figures/3-freq-both){#fig:freq-both}

In addition to demanding oversight through reporting, one common method states use to manage international NGOs is to position government officials within the governance structures of these organizations. The case study on China in the previous chapter described how the Chinese government now requires that all international NGOs have a formal sponsor from the Communist Party. Many responding organizations report similar arrangements in their countries. In Eastern Europe, an MP who chairs the education committee personally monitors the educational programming of one INGO,[^91] a foreign affairs minister works directly with an education INGO in South America,[^92] and the former president of a European nation is a member of and consults for a human rights INGO, representing the diplomatic interests of their country through the NGO's programming.[^93] It is unclear what the consequences of going against government preferences when officials are so closely involved in INGO decisions—few respondents with bureaucrats and politicians in their organizations opted to describe what might happen. However, a human rights INGO working in East Africa explained that officials "could close down the project" if government demands are not met.[^94]

Regulations can give bureaucrats final say in INGO programming even without formal participation in governance. An advocacy organization working in West Africa must have its work checked and approved by the government and its programs are sometimes vetoed and "over powered,"[^95] while other organizations are required to get final ministry-level approval for their activities, programs, and publications.[^96] In other cases, regulations dictate that INGO programming falls under the direct supervision and control of local governments, leaving organizations with little flexibility in how they operate, essentially turning them into arms of the government—an organization working in West Africa had several of its programmatic themes subsumed by the government,[^97] with bureaucrats determining which activities the NGO should handle.  

Notably, however, having bureaucrats involved in organizational decision making  does not always disadvantage INGOs. @Teets:2014 has shown that INGOs working in China systematically shop for the optimal oversight agency, work carefully to build positive relationships with their local officials, and seek to provide tangible benefits for their government sponsors by providing needed services and offering crucial expertise. INGO respondents confirm this finding, with many describing their efforts to cultivate relationships with politicians and bureaucrats. A human rights INGO working in Western Africa learned that the current and former ministers of justice were both personally opposed to the death penalty. The organization built rapport with the ministry and provided information, tools, and advice to the ministers to help them work toward national abolition of the death penalty. These close connections have subsequently helped the INGO obtain legal status in the country—in 2016, one of the INGO's local partner organizations faced a noticeably smooth registration process because of its work with the government.[^98] Other INGOs pursue similar strategies, inviting government staff, officials, police, and judges to serve in advisory positions on specific projects and programs and encouraging bureaucrats to participate in stakeholder meetings, with the explicit goal of increasing their influence and standing with key decision makers.[^99] Thus, when possible, INGOs attempt to harness and shape direct government involvement in their favor.

## Operations

The legal environment dictates more than just the registration requirements for INGOs. Laws regarding NGO operations give governments control over some aspects of their advocacy and programming. This control is sometimes accidental and indirect. For instance, an orphanage working in Central Asia reports regularly getting locked into programs because of bureaucratic inefficiency. Their host country requires that all international NGOs dealing with orphans fully fund all children for a full calendar year. However, their donor sponsorship funds are collected irregularly and can sometimes disappear, leading to difficult financial decisions:

> We are not allowed by the … government to withdraw the names of orphans sponsored until the end of each year even if we did not receive funding for that orphan but we still must pay for that orphan until the end of each year.[^100]

This regulation severely limits the organization's flexibility and allows the government to force the orphanage to dip into its general fund to guarantee its services. Other respondents report similar experiences of host governments using bureaucratic delays and rules to lock INGOs into their programs.[^101] This indirect form of control allows the government to guarantee access to INGO services regardless of donor cash flow, but imposes significant financial strain on those INGOs.

Government involvement can also be more overt. Rules can give bureaucrats final say in INGO programming. An advocacy organization working in West Africa must have its work checked and approved by the government and its programs are sometimes vetoed and "over powered,"[^102] while other organizations are required to get final ministry-level approval for their activities, programs, and publications.[^103] In other cases, regulations dictate that INGO programming falls under the direct supervision and control of local governments, leaving organizations with little flexibility in how they operate, essentially turning them into arms of the government—an organization working in West Africa had several of its programmatic themes subsumed by the government,[^104] with bureaucrats determining which activities the NGO should handle.

# Appendix


## Definition of international NGO

There is no central database of all international NGOs active in the world, and indeed, creating such a directory is impossible, due to issues with both definitions and logistics. There is no universally accepted definition of "international" or "nongovernmental," and existing directories vary in what counts as an INGO. For instance, the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) defines international NGOs as any internationally-focused organization that is not created by an intergovernmental agreement, which essentially designates NGOs as a catch-all category for any organization that is not a purely governmental body [@ecosoc-resolution]. In an effort to narrow this definition, the Yearbook of International Organizations—a widely used source for research on international organizations [see @SmithWest:2005; @Munck:2010; @BarryBellClay:2015; @Murdie:2014; @Johnson:2014; among others]—defines international NGOs based on a set of seven rules related to an entity's organizational structure, purpose, and activity, and adds the additional stipulation that an organization's operations target three or more countries [@ybio-explanation]. 

For the purposes of this study, in an effort to capture the broadest range of potential organizations, I consider an international nongovernmental organization to be any organizations that is not privately or governmentally incorporated that conducts advocacy, provides services, or otherwise works in at least *one* country other than the one it is headquartered in. Using this minimalist definition provides several benefits. First, it allows me to bracket the longstanding definitional debate discussed above. While this debate raises important questions about the nature of international NGOs, the scope of their operations, and their role in global politics, it has less bearing on how these organizations are treated by their host countries. Legislation and regulation governing the behavior of international NGOs is not based on whether an organization has official ECOSOC status, works in a certain number of countries, or defines itself as international or transnational. Instead, the legal regime for regulating INGOs in most countries looks at more practical organizational characteristics, such as an organization's organizational structure (members of the board, staff ratios, etc.) or sources of funding, and laws tend to target both domestic and international NGOs simultaneously.

Second, stricter definitions of internationality, such as the Yearbook's requirement that an organization works in at least three countries, omit smaller NGOs that are nonetheless international. Broadening the definition of international NGO allows me to better capture the experiences of these smaller organizations and permits me to explore the effect of organization size and geographic scope on its response to regulations. The number of countries an organization works in likely affects its flexibility—if an INGO works only in one country, it cannot easily shift its resources to another country in response to harsher restrictions, while an INGO with programs in dozens of of countries can likely make more programmatic adjustments.

## Creation of list of international NGOs

As discussed in the introduction to the dissertation, I look at how government regulations affect international NGOs working in two general sectors: freedom of expression, representing more contentious human rights and advocacy-focused organizations, and education, representing ostensibly less contentious service provision organizations. The Yearbook of International Organizations conveniently classifies organizations by issue area, which allowed me to collect contact information for organizations dealing both with freedom of expression (all organizations categorized as "Censorship", "Journalism," and "Media") and education (all organizations categorized as "Education").[^105] 

As noted previously, the Yearbook uses a more restrictive definition of international NGO that limits the pool of possible respondents to larger organizations working in multiple countries. Expanding this initial list of organizations to include smaller organizations is more difficult, however—the Yearbook is hand-curated, carefully organized, and updated annually, and its quality exceeds that of most other online directories of NGOs, which tend to only categorize organizations along broad issue areas (such as human rights or development) and do not distinguish between internationally- and domestically-oriented organizations. To augment the initial Yearbook-based list with smaller organizations, I added information from several additional NGO directories, falling into three broad categories:

- *General international NGOs*: The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) acts as a mediator between the United Nations and civil society organizations granted consultative status with the UN's ECOSOC. DESA maintains the integrated Civil Society Organizations (iCSO) System, a dedicated database of 27,000 DESA- and ECOSOC-affiliated NGOs that have registered themselves with the UN.[^106] The application form for inclusion in the database includes four options for an NGO's geographic scope, which permitted me to select 7,632 apparently international NGOs—I omitted organizations classified as local and national and kept only regional and international organizations. As this database does not indicate which issues organizations work on, I include all apparently international organizations in the sample. 
- *Development international NGOs*: The Directory of Development Organizations (DDO)[^107] is a privately-maintained list of nearly 15,000 development-focused NGOs, including thousands of organizations focused on education issues. The directory categorizes organizations according to their home country, but does not include information about the issues they work on. As such, I include all organizations in the sample.
- *Human rights international NGOs*: I augment the list of freedom of expression organizations by including two directories of human rights-focused NGOs: (1) the Arab Institute of Human Rights directory,[^108] and (2) a database of anti-human trafficking NGOs compiled by @HeissKelley:2016 and the Polaris Project.[^109] 

## Sampling strategy

With the exception of the ECOSOC list, none of these directories indicate where the organizations work—only their organizational headquarters. As such, there is no systematic way to disambiguate international NGOs, as I define them, from domestic NGOs. To account for this, I use an early question in the survey to filter out domestic NGOs.[^110] Organizations that indicate they only work in one country leave the survey early and are not included in this analysis. 

I faced an empirical tradeoff with the survey's sampling strategy. I could attempt to calculate accurate population estimates and boost the survey's inferential power by creating probability-based panels of potential participants, but doing so would reduce the possible number of responses substantially, especially given the impossibility of distinguishing between domestic and international organizations. Additionally, given the composition of the lists, the universe of possible NGO sectors is inherently not representative of the entire INGO sector—the UN's list of ECOSOC-affiliated NGOs is self-selected, and the other lists are domain-based, selecting only organizations focused on education, development, freedom of expression, human rights, and human trafficking. Finally, it was impossible to know how many of the organizations listed in these directories were defunct and unreachable. Sampling from such an unstable population would result in a small number of usable responses. To maximize the chances of identifying the greatest number of *international* organizations in the list, I instead conduct a non-probability list-based internet survey [@AAPOR:2016, 43]. While this decision increases the number of responses, it limits the inferential and statistical power of the sample and tempers the conclusions and findings. Regardless, though results from the survey are not perfectly reflective of the entire global INGO sector, they do reveal important insights and trends about a self-selecting subset of organizations working on education and human rights issues. 

## Survey details

Combining all five of these lists yielded 33,973 potential INGOs (see @tbl:summary-list). A large proportion of these organizations, however, had invalid, outdated, or incomplete information. Prior to conducting the survey, I used an e-mail verification service to verify that the organization's internet domain name was valid and that the e-mail address listed existed at the domain. More than three-fourths of the final list contained apparently valid organizations (26,772), with wide variation across directories—nearly all the organizations listed in the DDO and in the UN's iCSO list were valid, while less than a third of the organizations in the Yearbook of International Organizations had usable e-mail addresses. Even with this cleaner list, 9,182 e-mail invitations were rejected (or bounced) by their receiving servers, including more than half of the apparently valid DDO organizations. Ultimately, only 17,590 (or 52%) of the complete list of organizations received an e-mail invitation, which indicates significant problems with maintaining up-to-date information in online directories of NGOs.

Traditional survey-based research will often report a survey's response rate. Response rates are associated with probability samples and rely on knowing the exact size of the survey sample. With non-probability list-based internet surveys, however, it is impossible to know how many potential respondents were exposed to the invitation or how often they were exposed—the only response data known about possible respondents is the number of members invited to the survey and the number of members who respond to and complete the survey. Because of this, response rates are impossible to calculate for this kind of survey [@AAPOR:2016]. Instead, a somewhat comparable participation (or completion) rate can be calculated, dividing the number of usable responses by the total number of initial survey invitations [@CallegaroDiSogra:2008, 1021–22]. The participation rate cannot be used as a measure of possible nonresponse error, but it can indicate the overall efficiency of the panel [@AAPOR:2016, 49]. 

Of the 17,590 organizations that potentially received the initial survey invitation, 537 completed the survey, 104 provided a partial (but usable) response,[^111] 311 ended the survey early, and the remainder indicated that they did not work internationally or did not respond, either because they self-selected out without answering any questions (since the first page of the survey indicated that the survey was for international NGOs), or because they did not open the invitation e-mail. This yielded a participation rate of 3.8%, which is low, but to be expected, given that it was impossible to specifically target international NGOs prior to conducting the survey. The questions in the survey were divided into two general sections related to (1) respondents' organizations and (2) their work in one of the countries they work in. I allowed respondents to answer country-specific questions for multiple countries if they wanted, but only eighteen provided responses for more than one country. The survey thus resulted in 641 usable organization-level responses and 659 country-level responses.

## Analytic strategy and possible biases

Online surveys pose other methodological challenges beyond issues of sampling. My list inherently omits any international NGOs without an active English-based online presence, ignoring organizations that do not engage with the UN or other English-centered umbrella organization, organizations that lack technical capacity to maintain a current website or access the internet to respond to the survey, or organizations that purposely do not publish their information online. Accordingly, this survey does not represent all INGOs. Though it is impossible to tell exactly how respondents and nonrespondents differed in their choice to complete the survey, as I do not have complete information about the pool of potential respondents, more European and American NGOs responded than those based in Asia and Africa, likely because of these technological and linguistic barriers—of the organizations in the master database with a known headquarters location, roughly 2.5% of Asian NGOs and 3% of African NGOs responded, in contrast to nearly 6% of both European and American NGOs.[^112]

I took several steps to address these biases and threats to validity, based on the methods and recommendations of others [@Buthe:2011; @EdwardsRobertsClarke:2009; @HeissKelley:2016]. After cleaning the initial list of e-mails, I sent each potential respondent an initial invitation, followed up with a reminder two weeks later, and a final reminder after another two weeks.[^113] To reduce language barriers, respondents were encouraged to answer all free questions in their native language. Because the survey deals with sensitive questions about organizational strategy in potentially precarious political contexts, respondents were informed that their responses would be kept anonymous. To maintain anonymity when discussing the results of the survey, each respondent was assigned a randomly assigned four-digit ID number, and quotes from the free response questions were stripped of potentially identifying information. The exact countries where respondents work were also anonymized and are offered instead as general regions (e.g. Ghana is reported as West Africa; Thailand is reported as Southeast Asia).

The nature of the population of INGOs poses an additional challenge for analyzing organizational strategy. To isolate the effect of country-level policies on INGOs, the survey asks organizations about their experiences working in *one* country, yet many INGOs work in multiple countries. An early question in the survey asked respondents to identify all the countries their has organization worked in, and later in the survey, respondents were asked to choose one of those pre-selected countries to answer a set of country-specific questions. This introduces additional bias into the survey responses—especially for organizations working in dozens of different countries—since respondents were given some choice about their responses. However, allowing for self-selection of target country was, to some extent, unavoidable given how little was known about the sample population *a priori*. Randomly offering one country from the subset of countries organizations identified previously could present a respondent with a country in which an organization engages in only minor work (e.g. an organization that attends an annual conference in one country may indicate that they have worked there), yielding less-than-useful country-level responses. 

Furthermore, to avoid priming respondents' opinions of their experiences with host governments, I did not ask organizations to choose the country they felt most restricted working in (though that was the main purpose of the survey)—the survey simply asked respondents to choose one of the previously selected countries. This introduces a concern that organizations may have chosen to answer questions about easier, less restrictive countries. Nearly half of respondents answered questions about a country that had a less restrictive civil society regulatory environment (as measured by the CSRE index from chapter 2) than the average CSRE across their total portfolio of host countries, 35% answered about countries that were more restrictive than the average CSRE, and 21% answered about countries with the same level of restrictiveness as the average (see @fig:selected-easier in the appendix). To some extent, respondents did tend to provide answers about their work in less restrictive countries compared to their total portfolio, possibly to avoid answering more difficult questions.

That said, there is some evidence that respondents answered questions about the countries with which they were most familiar, regardless of the restrictiveness of the regulatory environment. Respondents headquartered in specific regions tended to answer questions about their work in countries in a way that reflected general patterns for that region. For instance, that fit a general pattern for INGOs based in their same region. For instance, 44% of all Europe-based respondents indicated that they conduct work in other European countries, with 23% working in Asia, 18% in Africa, and 14% in the Americas (see @fig:regions-sankey in the appendix). Correspondingly, 46% of Europe-based respondents answered questions about their work in Europe, 20% about Asia, 20% in Africa, and 14% in the Americas. This distribution closely mirrors that of the countries these INGOs had selected and shows that, at least at a regional level, organizations did not answer questions about their work in a less restrictive region (such as Europe). This pattern of similarity holds for INGOs working in all other regions, with the exception of Africa-based INGOs—while 66% of African INGOs indicated working in other African countries, 83% answered questions about their work in other African countries, indicating that respondents likely chose to answer questions about countries that were most familiar and similar to their home countries and not necessarily because of the CSRE. 

Since the survey was designed to not have strong statistical or inferential power (opting to maximize possible international NGO response instead), the findings are not fully representative of all INGOs. Additionally, several INGOs explicitly opted to not take the survey for fears of political reprisal, despite the promised privacy safeguards. As such, the results omit the most at-risk organizations. Despite this, the findings highlight important trends in how INGOs react to the regulatory environments of their host countries and provide useful (albeit imperfect) tests of the theory of amicable contempt. I report basic summary statistics and cross-tabulations of survey responses and I use Bayesian inferential statistics to check for differences in means and associations within responses. Bayesian methods are especially appropriate for making tentative exploratory inferences from this kind of data, particularly when combined with data visualizations and graphs [@Gelman:2003], and accordingly, I rely heavily on statistical graphics when making inferences. As with previous statistical chapters, I use weakly informative prior distributions for sample parameters and I obtain the posterior distribution of the CSRE with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and simulate values from the joint posterior distribution of sample parameters.[^114]

In the absence of strong statistical power, I supplement inferences with interpretive analysis of the survey's free response answers. Only 19 respondents (2.8%) declined to answer any of the survey's 36 open-ended questions, and most answered between 8–16 questions, resulting in a sizable corpus of qualitative insights into INGO experiences with their host governments. Where possible, I quote extensively from these responses to provide deeper anecdotal support of organizations's experiences and decisions working with the governments of their target countries.

[^45]:	Though it is important to note that this high percentage is likely tied to who responded to the survey—as explained previously, more that 50%, of respondents were the organization's CEO, executive director, or other high-level officer.

	"Extremely familiar" and "Very familiar" are collapsed to "Very familiar"; "Moderately familiar" and "Slightly familiar" are collapsed to "Somewhat familiar."

[^105]:	The Yearbook also follows a detailed typology of organizational type, distinguishing between various forms of international organization, such as research bodies, intergovernmental bodies, commercial enterprises, and so forth. For this list of international NGOs, I excluded any organization classified as any of the the following types:

	- Type I: H (Inactive or dissolved international organizations), J (Recently reported or proposed international organizations), R (Religious orders, fraternities and secular institutes), S (Autonomous conference series), T (Multilateral treaties and agreements), and U (Inactive or dissolved non-conventional bodies)
	- Type II: c (conference series), d (dissolved, dormant), e (commercial enterprise), g (intergovernmental), and s (information suspect)
	- Type III: Alumni and Veterans, European Union Bodies, FAO Bodies, ILO Bodies, NATO Bodies, Parliaments, Political Parties, Treaties, United Nations Bodies, WHO Bodies, Corporations, Companies, and Intergovernmental Communities

[^110]:	Q2.4: Does your organization work in a country other than the country in which it is headquartered?

[^111]:	To count as a valid partial response, a responded had to answer at least 20 questions in the survey, and at least 6 had to come from the section asking about the organization's work in a specific country.

[^112]:	The difference between these proportions is highly significant ($P(\text{\% Africa} - \text{\% Europe} < 0) = 1$).

[^113]:	For technical details on how the invitation was sent and designed, see [notebook.andrewheiss.com/project/diss-ingos-in-autocracies/survey-technical-details/](https://notebook.andrewheiss.com/project/diss-ingos-in-autocracies/survey-technical-details/).

[^114]:	I use Stan [@stan] through R [@rstan; @r-project] to generate 4 MCMC chains with 2,000 iterations in each chain, 1,000 of which are used for warmup. All chains converge; I assess convergence with visual inspection, and diagnostic plots are included the dissertation appendix.

	I use the medians of the simulated values from the MCMC samples as coefficient estimates, and use the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles as lower and upper limits for 95% credible intervals. Finally, I declare an effect statistically significant if the posterior probability of being different from zero is larger than 0.95.
