> *To work around restrictions NGOs can work on less sensitive topics, with friendly government officials, partner with local organisations and try to funding sources that aren't considered "sensitive". All of that is being done very creatively by many on the ground. But, we have to ask ourselves whether doing so might compromise one's original intentions. Helping the government maintain the status quo in some ways undermines long-term prospects, as ultimately civil society does need a free press, a democratic government and freedom of association.*

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), foreign foundations, private donors, and scholars of international affairs flooded the Russia with aid and technical assistance. Among the most prominent early foreign entrants into the country's nascent civil society and political sectors were the Open Society Foundations (OSF), a philanthropic advocacy organization funded by American billionaire George Soros, and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace—America's "oldest international affairs think tank"[^2]—which created the Carnegie Moscow Center as a regional research hub. Throughout Russia's tumultuous post-Soviet history, OSF and the Carnegie Center were influential proponents of political liberalization and democratization. The  two organizations pursued different strategies—OSF funded and supported domestic NGOs working on issues of education, freedom of expression, and human rights, while the Carnegie Center supported scholars and foreign policy experts in Russia and abroad, funding and disseminating white papers, reports, and general research and advocacy for Eastern European liberalization—but the two shared the same fundamental goal of improving human rights and the rule of law in Russia and the region.

In December 2015, after more than two decades of advocacy in the country, OSF ceased all operations in Russia, terminated all its ongoing programs, and stopped funding local Russian NGOs. The Carnegie Center, meanwhile, continues its research in Moscow today. OSF had been forced to leave after being deemed an "undesirable organization" earlier that year—a new legal status created by a 2015 law passed by the Putin administration that allowed the government to blacklist and expel any organization it felt was too dangerous and threatening. 

OSF's expulsion in 2015 followed three years of heavy legal restrictions. After Vladimir Putin was inaugurated as president for a second time in 2012, he almost immediately turned the regulatory environment against INGOs and foreign-backed NGOs. The administration passed a 2012 law designating a subset of foreign-connected NGOs as "foreign agents," recycling a Cold War-era term reserved for anti-Soviet spies and collaborators,[^3] and more than 100 domestic NGOs have been labeled as such.[^4] The 2015 Undesirable Organizations law expanded this 2012 legislation and specifically targeted international human rights NGOs. The government's initial list of undesirable organizations included just five INGOs: Human Rights Watch, Memorial, Amnesty International, OSF, and the Carnegie Moscow Center,[^5] but by the second draft of the list, the Carnegie Center had been removed and spared the chopping block.[^6] 

For decades, the OSF and the Carnegie Center had shared similar experiences with harsh legal restrictions in Russia, but in 2015, the two organizations diverged dramatically. Why did one continue to work in the country while the other withdrew?

According to a high-level OSF program officer, a crucial factor for deciding to support NGOs in a country is the safety of the activists and organizations they support. If the Foundations' support of an organization leads to jail time, harassment, or otherwise impairs or imperils those they support, they withdraw or halt that support. OSF does have a clear, calculated, and rational vision for how it operates. The decision to stay or leave a country is based primarily on how well the organization's work promotes change. If OSF can no longer make satisfactory change, whether because of the legal environment, local political developments, cultural shifts, wars, revolutions, or any other external factor that influences their ability to affect change and reform, the organization reaches a tipping point where "the jig is up" and they withdraw and move their resources elsewhere. OSF is motivated by cost-benefit utility function that determines how they allocate their programming and funding. Through their "judicious calculus," the foundation works to balance the need to affect satisfactory change against the injunction to "do no harm" and need to guarantee the safety of their partners. Pragmatism drives their organizational decisions.[^7]

In contrast, the Carnegie Center was motivated by a different set of core principles and values. Because the organization has historically produced detailed research on international and regional political affairs, it has long prized its cozy access to Russian government officials. As Putin's regime began to crack down on INGOs starting in 2012, the Center adjusted its strategy and programming to remain in the country. Three of its most outspoken liberal researchers and activists were let go between 2012–2014, replaced with research fellows more friendly to Putin. Few of the Center's public events since 2012 have discussed internal Russian politics or Putin's push to become a stronger regional—as Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014, the Center generally remained silent [@Kirchick:2015]. The Carnegie Center's desire to remain in the country drove its organizational decisions, but at the cost of potentially compromising its reputation and reducing the value of its programming. 

This sharp divergence between OSF and the Carnegie Center illustrates a broader trend occurring on a global scale. Since the 1990s, INGOs have emerged as a cornerstone of global governance [@Lipschutz:1992; @AhmedPotter:2006] and have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes [@Heiss:2016a]. Autocrats, in turn, work to regulate and restrict the activities and programming of international and foreign-funded NGOs working their countries, and often force INGOs to make difficult organizational decisions. What determines when INGOs adhere to authoritarian legal restrictions (like the Carnegie Center), resist government intrusions into organizational practices, or pull out of the country entirely (like OSF)? Why do INGOs work in these regimes if their services and advocacy can potentially help the regime? More generally, how do INGOs adapt to their institutional context and what tactics do they use to stay in engaged in the countries they target?

In this chapter, I argue that the political, legal, and regulatory institutions of the countries that INGOs target and work in have a substantial influence on these organizations' strategies and programming. I present an original theoretical model to explain and predict how INGOs respond to authoritarian regulations and restrictions, given an organization's core principles, its instrumental concerns, and its power relative to the regime, and I test this theory using the results from a global survey of more than 600 INGOs.


# What influences INGO behavior?

INGOs have long been treated as a "black box" in much of the existing academic work on international institutions, and have often been assumed to act as altruistic bulwarks against the state, filling policy and issue gaps in the international system, and run by managers with only the best intentions [@Corry:2010; @Skjelsbaek:1971; @NyeKeohane:1971; @Bartelson:2006]. In the past decade, however, scholars have worked to move beyond this simplistic view and uncover the determinants of INGO behavior. @PrakashGugerty:2010a helped spearhead a new theoretical trend, arguing that advocacy INGOs should be seen as firms working in policy markets, driven by normative and instrumental concerns, and motivated organizational survival and growth. Seen in this more nuanced light, it became clear that, like firms, INGOs are subject to interagency conflicts, face issues with accountability, compete for scarce resources, and struggle to get their issues on the global agenda. @HeissJohnson:2016 provide a useful typology for this newer body of work (summarized in [@fig:ISR-pyramid]), which organizes these emerging structural determinants of INGO behavior into three related and interlocking categories: (1) the internal structure of the INGO, (2) the external dynamics and relationships faced by the INGO, and (3) the institutional context that defines the boundaries of INGO action. 

![A unified framework for analyzing INGO behavior [@HeissJohnson:2016]](../../Graphics/ISR-pyramid){#fig:ISR-pyramid}

## Internal traits

A significant portion of INGO behavior is shaped by the preferences and ideals of its managers, employees, and volunteers, who in turn shape the organization's stated mission, vision, and values. For example, an organization's managerial structure can influence the success of its programming. @Wong:2012 shows that INGOs can centralize or decentralize different forms of managerial power: the power to propose new goals and missions, the power to enforce those goals, and the power to actually implement those proposals. Organizations that successfully centralize proposal power while decentralizing implementation power are better able to pursue a central agenda without stifling local creativity, thus leading to better success [@Wong:2012].

## Interactions with other actors

INGOs do not operate in isolation—even if an organization perfectly balances and refines its internal managerial structure, it still must interact with third-party actors as it pursues its policy agenda. An INGO's interactions with these other external actors shape its behavior. Early work on opening the INGO black box focused on many of these external factors. For example, @Cooley:2002 argues that competition among INGOs actually leads to perverse outcomes and sectoral insecurity, as organizations will often undermine their competitors, withhold information, act unilaterally, and seek government rents. Additionally, @Bob:2002 shows that INGOs compete in a "harsh, Darwinian marketplace where legions of desperate groups vie for scarce attention, sympathy, and money" [@Bob:2002, 37]. Organizations that are experts at emotive marketing, employ native English speakers, use charismatic spokespeople, and craft their messages to fit Western sensibilities are far more effective in the global community than their competitors. 

The relationships that form as organizations interact also have a direct impact on INGO power and influence. @Carpenter:2014 demonstrates the importance of the shape and nature of INGO networks. INGOs are most able to push new normative ideas onto the global agenda if they are connected to key nodes—or gatekeepers—in a network, who then vet the proposals and give (or deny) them credibility and legitimacy. In general, the more connected or centralized an INGO is in relation to other organizations, the more influential it will be. @Murdie:2014 provides additional evidence of the power of INGO networks, finding that human rights INGOs that network and collaborate together increase their advocacy output. The nature of these network relationships influences the quality of this work, though—as more organizations free ride and rely on larger, more prominent INGOs, advocacy output decreases.

## Institutional environment

Beyond the influence of internal and external actors, INGOs are also shaped by more elusive actors—the political structures and institutions they interact with [@HeissJohnson:2016; @GugertyPrakash:2010; @BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. INGOs are products of the legal regulations, historical precedents, political trends, and cultural norms of both their home countries and they countries they target, all help define the boundaries for INGO operations. 

In contrast with internal NGO traits and interactions with other actors, the effect of the institutional environment on international NGOs is relatively understudied [@BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. @Stroup:2012 shows that the organizational structures and missions of INGOs are deeply tied to the cultural and legal environments of their home countries. For example, she argues that CARE USA's mission reflects American norms of efficiency and results-oriented pragmatism by using a professional staff, securing large amounts of government funding, and avoiding anti-American advocacy. In contrast, Amnesty International, based in the United Kingdom, eschews many of the stricter norms of business-like efficiency and professionalization to focus more on advocacy work. Additionally, because Amnesty International refuses government funding (in part because of the historical absence of government funding for charities), it focuses much of its advocacy work on British and American human rights abuses. 

Emerging research on domestic nonprofit organizations in the United States can inform future research into INGO behavior, revealing how NGOs both (1) are adversely affected by the rules, regulations, and institutional structures governing NGO activities, and (2) manipulate those structures for their own benefit and organizational survival.

First, institutional rules and norms can create inefficiencies in nonprofit programming. For instance, NGOs often change their behavior to obtain external government funding. Government grants (both domestic and foreign) limit the flexibility of nonprofits by imposing strict reporting requirements that can shift these organizations' missions [@Suarez:2011], and by crowding out private donations [@KimVan-Ryzin:2014]. Government grant requirements often insist that applicant organizations pursue specific behaviors, such as collaboration with other organizations, even if collaboration is not the optimal strategy for the organization. In fact, because of this push for collaboration, regardless of its consequences, one of the best predictors of a nonprofit organization receiving government funding is whether or not it collaborates with other nonprofits [@Suarez:2008; @Suarez:2011]. As these organizations create inefficient collaborative networks, organizational objectives and missions are often dropped or discarded in pursuit of additional funding, resulting in a market failure [@WitesmanHeiss:2016]. These inefficiencies are directly tied to the structural incentives to collaborate, pushing organizations to adopt suboptimal strategies in the interest of securing funding. Foreign NGOs suffer similar inefficiencies and crowding out effects [@GugertyKremer:2008], but work remains for research on international NGOs.

Second, rather than shift and adjust their organizational missions and values to fit the legal environment, many American nonprofits maneuver *within* that environment and find workarounds for their preferred strategies. That is, nonprofits in the United States generally do not change their missions—they change their legal and organizational structures to make their missions happen.[^8] In the United States, nonprofits typically incorporate initially as 501(c)(3) organizations. While this designation provides significant tax benefits (i.e. full tax exemption), IRS regulations restrict some of the activities and income generation strategies these organizations can pursue. In order to become more politically engaged, nonprofits will often create a 501(c)(4) or (c)(6) subsidiary, which offers fewer tax benefits but allows for direct political advocacy. Similarly, IRS regulations impose an operational test on nonprofits' business activities. If an organization generates significant unrelated business income (UBI) it can fail this test and lose its exempt status. To prevent this from happening, 501(c)(3)s will often spin off a for-profit subsidiary that feeds its income into the main organization [@Daniel:2014; @SloanGrizzleKim:2015]. Ultimately, US nonprofits learn to deftly maneuver the legal regulatory environment to maximize their revenue and carry out their preferred programs.[^9] 

International NGOs working in dictatorships likely also try to bend the legal environment of the countries they work in, but are more limited in their influence on the domestic politics. Pushing the envelope with organizational and legal innovations in these countries also carries significant risk—if an INGO gets too creative in spinning off subsidiaries or partnering with domestic NGOs, the regime or ruling party can expel it.


# Explaining INGO responses to authoritarian regulations

## Theoretical framework

International and transnational NGOs do not operate in a vacuum. As described previously, INGOs are influenced by a host of factors beyond their stated mission vision, values, and strategies. In addition to these well established behavioral determinants, the regulatory environment for foreign-based advocacy and service provision in autocratic nations plays a critical role in shaping the behavior of international NGOs that work in those countries. 

An INGO's mission and menu of programs will often conflict with the preferences of the regime. Accordingly, an organization must decide how to adapt its programming to fit the requirements and needs of its host country. This decision can be difficult, pitting conflicting organizational values against each other. If the organization is too antagonistic, contentious, or principled, it runs the risk of expulsion, potentially leaving the INGO unable to continue its work in the country. However if the organization is too cooperative, its selection of programs may not be credible or effective as the NGO kowtows to the dictator's demands.

I offer a novel theoretical framework to conceptualize this dynamic relationship between dictators and INGOs.[^10] Using an adaptation of negotiation theory [@Raiffa:1982; @Mayer:2010], I argue that the interaction between authoritarian regimes and INGOs in any given issue area (human rights, development, advocacy, etc.) can be modeled in simple two-dimensional policy space (see [@fig:winsets]). Each actor has a preference for a certain level of advocacy or service provision, marked as solid circles in the figure (Regime~ideal~ and INGO~ideal~). Regimes set and implement *de jure* policies to prevent INGO programming from going beyond their ideal point (the reserve value or "best alternative to a negotiated agreement" (BATNA) in negotiation theoretic terms), while INGOs will engage in programming that (when possible) fits within the bounds set by the regime. In addition to these ideal points, each actor has a range of flexibility in the implementation of their regulations or programming, shown in the horizontal lines flanking the ideal points (negotiation space in negotiation theory terms). The space where the two preference ranges overlap (the zone of possible agreement (ZOPA) in negotiation theory) determines both the regime's *de facto* level of restrictions and the INGO's actual mix of programming in that country. 

![Programming preferences in two-dimensional policy space](../../Graphics/winsets.pdf){#fig:winsets}

An authoritarian regime's INGO regulatory environment comprises two components: (1) formal *de jure* legislation and policies (represented by the ideal point) and (2) *de facto* implementation of those policies (represented by the negotiation space around the ideal point). Regimes will establish a regulatory environment for international civil society that falls along a continuum of restrictiveness, ranging from *tolerance*, or very few legal or actual restrictions on INGO programs, to *expulsion*, or a complete ban of all INGO activities. The larger the ZOPA, the more tolerant the regime will be about international NGOs working in their regimes, and vice versa—when there is no overlap, an INGO will face expulsion.

In turn, and analogous to the regime's regulatory environment, an INGO's response to authoritarian restrictions comprises three components: (1) the organization's normative principles and ideals, represented by the ideal point, (2) the organization's instrumental flexibility in actually implementing those principles, represented by the space around the ideal point, and (3) the alignment of an INGOs programming with regime preferences, represented by the distance between the two parties' ideal points. Parallel to the regime's initial imposition of the regulatory environment, NGOs will respond along a continuum of cooperation, ranging from *compliance*, or tolerance and cooperation with the legal limits imposed by the regime, to *antagonism*, or blatantly and openly resisting those restrictions. INGOs that engage in programming close to the authoritarian regime's preferences will be more compliant with the regulatory environment, while organizations that pursue more contentious programming will be more antagonistic.

![Possible authoritarian regulatory environments and corresponding INGO responses](../../Graphics/working_theory.pdf){#fig:working-theory}

The relationship between INGOs and authoritarian regimes is dynamic, as ideal points shift along the spectrum and negotiation spaces expand or contract. [@fig:working-theory] demonstrates a mix of possible regulatory environments and INGO responses. The Carnegie Moscow Center is an excellent example of compliance and tolerance. In response to the 2012 and 2015 anti-INGO laws, the Center shifted its ideal preferences, "sacrificing its intellectual independence and analytical rigor," to realign itself more closely with the regime and maintain its presence in the country [@Kirchick:2015]. OSF, on the other hand, is an example of antagonism and expulsion. Rather than soften its stance toward the regime or shift its resources to other less contentious programs within the country, OSF withdrew and has remained a vocal critic of the regime. 

INGOs can also be antagonistic in a tolerant environment. For example, tight networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while some INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012]. Likewise, INGOs can be compliant in an expulsive environment. Though China is currently in the midst of an unprecedented expansion of civil society and has cooperated with dozens of international NGOs, the regime has shuttered several small INGOs that work with seemingly innocuous issues like advocacy for disabled people.^[Josh Chin, "China Cracks Down on Foreign Nonprofits," *The Wall Street Journal*, March 6, 2015, [http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cracks-down-on-foreign-nonprofits-1425694223](http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cracks-down-on-foreign-nonprofits-1425694223).]

## Framework mechanisms

As noted earlier, three mechanisms factor in to an INGO's decision-making calculus and programming choices, each corresponding to an element of the theoretical model. The first two mechanisms—the ideal point and the region extending from that point—represent a tension peculiar to third sector organizations. INGOs must balance their normative principles against the instrumental need of organizational survival. Unlike states or firms that generally face singular goals, like maximizing national security or maximizing profits, INGOs face a tradeoff between mission and money and must pursue both simultaneously—they must "instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 489]. 

When their institutional environments are limited and restricted, INGOs face a strain on their stated mission, vision, and values. An organization whose programming and preferences do not overlap with the regime's established regulatory environment will encounter pressure from any of the three mechanisms as it seeks to remain in the country. Initially, the INGO will feel pressure to change its deeply held principles (or shift its ideal point) and reframe its mission and vision to be more friendly with the regime. An INGO can resist this pressure to comply, however, by behaving more instrumentally and increasing its operational flexibility (expanding the space around the ideal point). 

I define flexibility as the INGO's ability to protect its principled ideals through a range of instrumental strategies. If an INGO is able to marshal new resources, work with more partner organizations, request the support of powerful external actors, or pursue other strategies to circumvent, mitigate, or otherwise reduce the impact of government restrictions on their ideals, the organization will be able to find common ground with the regime and continue working in the country.

Finally, rather than shifting its ideals or expanding its flexibility, an INGO can attempt to gain more power relative to the government and induce the expansion of government preferences for their programming (i.e. pull the space around the regime's ideal point toward the INGO's range), often by offering critical services and expertise that the regime cannot provide to its own citizens, thus becoming indispensable to the state they work in (similar to the empires of NGOs in Haiti and Afghanistan, discussed earlier).

If an INGO does not make one of these three adjustments—shifting its ideal point, increasing its operational flexibility, or becoming essential for the regime—it runs a high risk of expulsion.


# Data and methods: a global survey of international NGOs

Studying INGOs that work in authoritarian regimes poses a difficult methodological challenge. There is extensive cross-country research on the relationship between authoritarian regimes and *domestic* institutions like civil society [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014; @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a;  @FrantzEzrow:2011], as well as detailed case studies of individual authoritarian regimes [@Blaydes:2011; @Chen:2012; @Weiss:2013; @Teets:2014; @Hildebrandt:2013; @Brownlee:2007], and autocracies in general [@LevitskyWay:2010]. However, beyond newer case study work [@Teets:2014], little research has looked at how authoritarian regimes and *international* nongovernmental institutions interact.

Additionally, there is a dearth of structured data on INGO activities or behavior. These organizations publish a wealth of unstructured data, such as annual reports, budgets, press releases, or calls to advocacy, but few have systematically compiled these data sources into usable datasets. Existing research either relies on event data parsed from large corpora of news reports or highly specific in-depth case studies based on interviews and other unstructured data. Each of these approaches, however, pose methodological challenges. Event data often yields weak or uninteresting results since event data algorithms were originally developed to track wars and interactions between global elites—not NGOs—while case studies tend to be too focused on a handful of prominent organizations, resulting in findings and theories that are likely not very generalizable [@BloodgoodSchmitz:2013; @MitchellSchmitz:2014]. For example, human rights INGO research has thus far been primarily concerned with Amnesty International and other similar organizations, such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), CARE International, or Oxfam [@Stroup:2012; @Wong:2012]. While there is utility in amassing thick descriptions of INGO activities, more must be done. @MitchellSchmitz:2014 argue that INGO case studies need to be combined with large, more representative analyses to better understand the organizations that work on specific issue areas as a whole. To this end, I test my theory of INGO behavior by conducting an online global survey of international NGOs that work in authoritarian regimes.[^11]

## Definition of international NGO

There is no central database of all international NGOs active in the world, and indeed, creating such a directory is impossible, due to issues with both definitions and logistics. There is no universally accepted definition of "international" or "nongovernmental," and existing directories vary in what counts as an INGO. For instance, the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) defines international NGOs as any internationally-focused organization that is not created by an intergovernmental agreement, which essentially designates NGOs as a catch-all category for any organization that is not a purely governmental body [@ecosoc-resolution]. In an effort to narrow this definition, the Yearbook of International Organizations—a widely used source for research on international organizations (see @SmithWest:2005; @Munck:2010; @BarryBellClay:2015; @Murdie:2014; @Johnson:2014; among others)—defines international NGOs based on a set of seven rules related to an entity's organizational structure, purpose, and activity, and adds the additional stipulation that an organization's operations target three or more countries [@ybio-explanation]. 

For the purposes of this study, in an effort to capture the broadest range of potential organizations, I consider an international nongovernmental organization to be any organizations that is not privately or governmentally incorporated that conducts advocacy, provides services, or otherwise works in at least *one* country other than the one it is headquartered in. Using this minimalist definition provides several benefits. First, it allows me to bracket the longstanding definitional debate discussed above. While this debate raises important questions about the nature of international NGOs, the scope of their operations, and their role in global politics, it has less bearing on how these organizations are treated by their host countries. Legislation and regulation governing the behavior of international NGOs is not based on whether an organization has official ECOSOC status, works in a certain number of countries, or defines itself as international or transnational. Instead, the legal regime for regulating INGOs in most countries looks at more practical organizational characteristics, such as an organization's organizational structure (members of the board, staff ratios, etc.) or sources of funding, and laws tend to target both domestic and international NGOs simultaneously.

Second, stricter definitions of internationality, such as the Yearbook's requirement that an organization works in at least three countries, omit smaller NGOs that are nonetheless international. Broadening the definition of international NGO allows me to better capture the experiences of these smaller organizations and permits me to explore the effect of organization size and geographic scope on its response to regulations. The he number of countries an organization works in likely affects its flexibility—if an INGO works only in one country, it cannot easily shift its resources to another country in response to harsher restrictions, while an INGO with programs in dozens of of countries can likely make more programmatic adjustments.

## Creation of list of international NGOs

As discussed in the introduction to the dissertation, I look at how government regulations affect international NGOs working in two general sectors: freedom of expression, representing more contentious human rights and advocacy-focused organizations, and education, representing ostensibly less contentious service provision organizations. The Yearbook of International Organizations conveniently classifies organizations by issue area, which allowed me to collect contact information for organizations dealing both with freedom of expression (all organizations categorized as "Censorship", "Journalism," and "Media") and education (all organizations categorized as "Education").[^12] 

As noted previously, the Yearbook uses a more restrictive definition of international NGO that limits the pool of possible respondents to larger organizations working in multiple countries. Expanding this initial list of organizations to include smaller organizations is more difficult, however—the Yearbook is hand-curated, carefully organized, and updated annually, and its quality exceeds that of most other online directories of NGOs, which tend to only categorize organizations along broad issue areas (such as human rights or development) and do not distinguish between internationally- and domestically-oriented organizations. To augment the initial Yearbook-based list with smaller organizations, I added information from several additional NGO directories, falling into three broad categories:

- *General international NGOs*: The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) acts as a mediator between the United Nations and civil society organizations granted consultative status with the UN's ECOSOC. DESA maintains the integrated Civil Society Organizations (iCSO) System, a dedicated database of 27,000 DESA- and ECOSOC-affiliated NGOs that have registered themselves with the UN.[^13] The application form for inclusion in the database includes four options for an NGO's geographic scope, which permitted me to select 7,632 apparently international NGOs—I omitted organizations classified as local and national and kept only regional and international organizations. As this database does not indicate which issues organizations work on, I include all apparently international organizations in the sample. 
- *Development international NGOs*: The Directory of Development Organizations (DDO)[^14] is a privately-maintained list of nearly 15,000 development-focused NGOs, including thousands of organizations focused on education issues. The directory categorizes organizations according to their home country, but does not include information about the issues they work on. As such, I include all organizations in the sample.
- *Human rights international NGOs*: I augment the list of freedom of expression organizations by including two directories of human rights-focused NGOs: (1) the Arab Institute of Human Rights directory,[^15] and (2) a database of anti-human trafficking NGOs compiled by @HeissKelley:2016 and the Polaris Project.[^16] 

## Sampling strategy

With the exception of the ECOSOC list, none of these directories indicate where the organizations work—only their organizational headquarters. As such, there is no systematic way to disambiguate international NGOs, as I define them, from domestic NGOs. To account for this, I use an early question in the survey to filter out domestic NGOs.[^17] Organizations that indicate they only work in one country leave the survey early and are not included in this analysis. 

I faced an empirical tradeoff with the survey's sampling strategy. I could attempt to calculate accurate population estimates and boost the survey's inferential power by creating probability-based panels of potential participants, but doing so would reduce the possible number of responses significant, especially given the impossibility of distinguishing between domestic and international organizations. Additionally, given the composition of the lists, the universe of possible NGO sectors is inherently not representative of the entire INGO sector—the UN's list of ECOSOC-affiliated NGOs is self-selected, and the other lists are domain-based, selecting only organizations focused on education, development, freedom of expression, human rights, and human trafficking. Finally, it was impossible to know how many of the organizations listed in these directories were defunct and unreachable. Sampling from such an unstable population would result in a small number of usable responses. To maximize the chances of identifying the greatest number of *international* organizations in the list, I instead conduct a non-probability list-based internet survey [@AAPOR:2016, 43]. While this decision increases the number of responses, it limits the inferential and statistical power of the sample and tempers the conclusions and findings. Regardless, though results from the survey are not perfectly reflective of the entire global INGO sector, they do reveal important insights and trends about a self-selecting subset of organizations working on education and human rights issues. 

## Survey details

Combining all five of these lists yielded 33,973 potential INGOs (see @tbl:summary-list). A large proportion of these organizations, however, had invalid, outdated, or incomplete information. Prior to conducting the survey, I used an e-mail verification service to verify that the organization's internet domain name was valid and that the e-mail address listed existed at the domain. More than three-fourths of the final list contained apparently valid organizations (26,772), with wide variation across directories—nearly all the organizations listed in the DDO and in the UN's iCSO list were valid, while less than a third of the organizations in the Yearbook of International Organizations had usable e-mail addresses. Even with this cleaner list, 9,182 e-mail invitations were rejected (or bounced) by their receiving servers, including more than half of the apparently valid DDO organizations. Ultimately, only 17,590 (or 52%) of the complete list of organizations received an e-mail invitation, which indicates significant problems with maintaining up-to-date information in online directories of NGOs.

Traditional survey-based research will often report a survey's response rate. Response rates are associated with probability samples and rely on knowing the exact size of the survey sample. With non-probability list-based internet surveys, however, it is impossible to know how many potential respondents were exposed to the invitation or how often they were exposed—the only response data known about possible respondents is the number of members invited to the survey and the number of members who respond to and complete the survey. Because of this, response rates are impossible to calculate for this kind of survey [@AAPOR:2016]. Instead, a somewhat comparable participation (or completion) rate can be calculated, dividing the number of usable responses by the total number of initial survey invitations [@CallegaroDiSogra:2008, 1021–22]. The participation rate cannot be used as a measure of possible nonresponse error, but it can indicate the overall efficiency of the panel [@AAPOR:2016, 49]. 

Of the 17,590 organizations that potentially received the initial survey invitation, 537 completed the survey, 104 provided a partial (but usable) response,[^18] 311 ended the survey early, and the remainder indicated that they did not work internationally or did not respond, either because they self-selected out without answering any questions (since the first page of the survey indicated that the survey was for international NGOs), or because they did not open the invitation e-mail. This yielded a participation rate of 3.8%, which is low, but to be expected, given that it was impossible to specifically target international NGOs prior to conducting the survey. The questions in the survey were divided into two general sections related to (1) respondents' organizations and (2) their work in one of the countries they work in. I allowed respondents to answer country-specific questions for multiple countries if they wanted, but only eighteen provided responses for more than one country. The survey thus resulted in 641 usable organization-level responses and 659 country-level responses.

## Analytic strategy and possible biases

Online surveys pose other methodological challenges beyond issues of sampling. My list inherently omits any international NGOs without an active English-based online presence, ignoring organizations that do not engage with the UN or other English-centered umbrella organization, organizations that lack technical capacity to maintain a current website or access the internet to respond to the survey, or organizations that purposely do not publish their information online. Accordingly, this survey does not represent all INGOs. Though it is impossible to tell exactly how respondents and nonrespondents differed in their choice to complete the survey, as I do not have complete information about the pool of potential respondents, more European and American NGOs responded than those based in Asia and Africa, likely because of these technological and linguistic barriers.[^19]

I took several steps to address these biases and threats to validity, based on the methods and recommendations of others [@Buthe:2011; @EdwardsRobertsClarke:2009; @HeissKelley:2016]. After cleaning the initial list of e-mails, I sent each potential respondent an initial invitation, followed up with a reminder two weeks later, and a final reminder after another two weeks.[^20]To reduce language barriers, respondents were encouraged to answer all free questions in their native language. Because the survey deals with sensitive questions about organizational strategy in potentially precarious political contexts, respondents were informed that their responses would be kept anonymous. To maintain anonymity when discussing the results of the survey, each respondent was assigned a randomly assigned four-digit ID number, and any quotes from the free response questions were stripped of potentially identifying information.

The nature of the population of INGOs poses an additional challenge for analyzing organizational strategy. To isolate the effect of country-level policies on INGOs, the survey asks organizations about their experiences working in *one* country, yet many INGOs work in multiple countries. An early question in the survey asked respondents to identify all the countries their has organization worked in, and later in the survey, respondents were asked to choose one of those pre-selected countries to answer a set of country-specific questions. This introduces additional bias into the survey responses—especially for organizations working in dozens of different countries—since respondents were given some choice about their responses. However, allowing for self-selection of target country was, to some extent, unavoidable given how little was known about the sample population *a priori*. Randomly offering one country from the subset of countries organizations identified previously could present a respondent with a country in which an organization engages in only minor work (e.g. an organization that attends an annual conference in one country may indicate that they have worked there), yielding less-than-useful country-level responses. 

Furthermore, to avoid priming respondents' opinions of their experiences with host governments, I did not ask organizations to choose the country they felt most restricted working in (though that was the main purpose of the survey)—the survey simply asked respondents to choose one of the previously selected countries. This introduces a concern that organizations may have chosen to answer questions about easier, less restrictive countries. Nearly half of respondents answered questions about a country that had a less restrictive civil society regulatory environment (as measured by the CSRE index from chapter 2) than the average CSRE across their total portfolio of host countries, 35% answered about countries that were more restrictive than the average CSRE, and 21% answered about countries with the same level of restrictiveness as the average (see @fig:selected-easier in the appendix). To some extent, respondents did tend to provide answers about their work in less restrictive countries compared to their total portfolio, possibly to avoid answering more difficult questions.

That said, there is some evidence that respondents answered questions about the countries with which they were most familiar, regardless of the restrictiveness of the regulatory environment. Respondents headquartered in specific regions tended to answer questions about their work in countries in a way that reflected general patterns for that region. For instance, that fit a general pattern for INGOs based in their same region. For instance, 44% of all Europe-based respondents indicated that they conduct work in other European countries, with 23% working in Asia, 18% in Africa, and 14% in the Americas (see @fig:regions-sankey in the appendix). Correspondingly, 46% of Europe-based respondents answered questions about their work in Europe, 20% about Asia, 20% in Africa, and 14% in the Americas. This distribution closely mirrors that of the countries these INGOs had selected and shows that, at least at a regional level, organizations did not answer questions about their work in a less restrictive region (such as Europe). This pattern of similarity holds for INGOs working in all other regions, with the exception of Africa-based INGOs—while 66% of African INGOs indicated working in other African countries, 83% answered questions about their work in other African countries, indicating that respondents likely chose to answer questions about countries that were most familiar and similar to their home countries and not necessarily because of the CSRE. 

Since the survey was designed to not have strong statistical or inferential power (opting to maximize possible international NGO response instead), the findings reported below are primarily descriptive and highlight general trends in how human rights-focused and service provision-focused INGOs relate to the regulatory environments of their host countries. I report basic summary statistics and cross-tabulations of survey responses and I use Bayesian inferential statistics to check for differences in means and associations within responses. Bayesian methods are especially appropriate for making tentative exploratory inferences from this kind of data, particularly when combined with data visualizations and graphs [@Gelman:2003], and accordingly, I rely heavily on statistical graphics when making inferences. As with previous statistical chapters, I use weakly informative prior distributions for sample parameters and I obtain the posterior distribution of the CSRE with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and simulate values from the joint posterior distribution of sample parameters.[^21]

In the absence of strong statistical power, I supplement inferences with interpretive analysis of the survey's free response answers. Only 19 respondents (2.8%) declined to answer any of the survey's 36 open-ended questions, and most answered between 8–16 questions, resulting in a sizable corpus of qualitative insights into INGO experiences with their host governments. Where possible, I quote extensively from these responses to provide deeper anecdotal support of organizations's experiences and decisions working with the governments of their target countries.

I use the results of this global survey of international NGOs to measure each element of my theory: INGO ideal points, operational flexibility, and relationship with the target regime. I also measure how restricted INGOs feel in their host countries and which kinds of adjustments they have undertaken in response to changing regulations. In the remainder of this chapter, I provide a general overview of the subset of the INGO sector I surveyed. I then describe how restricted these organizations feel in their target countries and explore factors that are associated with those feelings of restriction, based on an organization's mission, flexibility, and relationship with the government. Next, I investigate how INGOs have reacted to changing restrictions and consider what factors are correlated with which types of reactions. I conclude by discussing how these results support the implications of my hypotheses and theory.

## Respondent overview

Before analyzing INGO perceptions of and responses to government restrictions, it is helpful to first look at the survey's respondents. The people who filled out the survey were quite familiar with their organizations' work and had an intimate perspective of their organizations' experiences and strategies. More than half of the respondents indicated that they were the executive director, president, secretary general, CEO, or other high-level officer for their organization, and roughly a third were staff members or program officers, with the remainder either public relations officers or receptionists. 

The INGOs that responded to the survey span the globe and work on a wide variety of issues and policies. The sample of INGOs have their headquarters spread across 93 different countries (see @fig:hq-countries), with roughly two thirds based in either Europe or the Americas, primarily in the US, UK, and Switzerland (see left panel of @fig:work-hq-regions). 

![Countries where INGOs are headquartered](../../Output/figures/3-hq-countries){#fig:hq-countries}

![Regions where INGOs are headquartered vs. regions about which INGOs answered questions](../../Output/figures/3-work-hq-regions){#fig:work-hq-regions}

While comparatively few INGOs are headquartered outside the Global North, these organizations have a worldwide reach.  As described previously, the survey asked respondents to select all the countries they work in and then allowed respondents to answer questions about their work in at least one. Though 20% of responding organizations indicated working only in one other country, the median number of countries was 6, with a mean of 16 (see @fig:countries-per-response in the appendix). In total, INGOs selected 169 different countries and answered questions about their work in 148. The regional distribution of INGO target countries reflects their broader scope and is almost a mirror image of these organizations' home regions—nearly two-thirds of respondents answered questions about their work in Africa and Asia (see right panel of @fig:work-hq-regions), the most underrepresented regions for NGO headquarters. This disparity could reflect the fact that INGOs from the Global South without a clear English-language internet presence were excluded from the sample, but the pattern also corresponds to similar findings in other surveys of global NGOs [@Limoncelli:2016; @HeissKelley:2016; @FootToftCesare:2015], reinforcing the idea that Northern-based NGOs tend to focus their work in the South.

Organizations also operate in a variety of political contexts. Unsurprisingly, given the concentration of INGOs in the Global North, the vast majority of respondents (90%) are headquartered in democracies. The countries these organizations work in, though, show more diversity in regime type—a third of respondents (219) answered questions about their work in autocratic regimes.

![Issues INGOs work on the most, divided by potential contentiousness](../../Output/figures/3-issues-worked-on){#fig:issues-worked-on}

Finally, responding organizations tackle a variety of issues (see @fig:issues-worked-on). The top three issues—education, development, and human rights—account for more than 60% of the respondents and reflect the the makeup of the sample of organizations collected in my database. The remaining 40% of organizations focus on topics that reflect other common issues addressed by global civil society, such as public health, environmental advocacy, disaster relief, human trafficking, post-conflict resolution, and cultural promotion. 

A key element of my theory of amicable contempt is alignment with the regime—INGOs working on issues that a regime finds favorable and inline with its own preferences will be treated differently than INGOs working on more threatening, less aligned topics. I divide the self-reported respondent issues into two levels of potential high or low regime contentiousness. As seen in @fig:issues-worked-on, highly contentious issues include human rights, advocacy, human trafficking, freedom of expression, conflict, and democracy assistance—all issues that pose a direct threat to regime policies and stability. Less contentious issues like education, development, health, and the environment reflect policy areas where governments are more willing to accept intervention and assistance. 

![Frequency of INGO engagement in different types of activities; organizations answered about one or more activities](../../Output/figures/3-main-activities){#fig:main-activities}

This division of INGOs into contentious and non contentious programming aligns well with the activities INGOs report engaging in. @fig:main-activities shows how frequently responding organizations work on a variety of types of programming, with each column sorted by the frequency of the "Always" option. If the division of contentiousness is correct, low contention INGOs should provide direct aid and services and engage in research and public education most frequently, since these types of programming pose little threat to the target country regime. High contention INGOs, on the other hand, should deal most often with more threatening activities like advocacy, political mobilization, and government monitoring. As seen in the figure, low contention organizations indicated always providing aid and services and engaging in research while only occasionally monitoring the government or mobilizing people. Interestingly, around 100 low contention organizations reported always engaging in advocacy. However, this form of advocacy appears to still be noncontentious: respondents describe advocating for "expanded public health programs,"[^22] "agr[i]culture,"[^23] "volunteerism,"[^24] "girls completing secondary education,"[^25] or expanding "access [to] health and justice."[^26] 

As expected, high contention organizations are most likely to report always engaging in advocacy and monitoring government policies, including advocating for the recognition and safety of human rights defenders,[^27]assisting with the "rehabilitation of repentant terrorists,"[^28] promoting religious freedom and human rights, [^29] and "holding … leaders accountable" for their policies and actions.[^30] These more contentious organizations engage in research and public education as the third most common primary activity. These educational activities clearly post more of a threat to the government and are more focused on human rights, such as maintaining a death penalty policy database,[^31] organizing activist training sessions and hackathons,[^32] or developing country-specific media literacy training programs.[^33] These organizations only sometimes provide direct aid and services, in contrast to their low contention counterparts. Finally, both kinds of INGOS are least likely to report always engaging in political mobilization, which is understandable for low contention organizations but surprising for those working on more contentious issues. INGOs may have conflated this kind of work with engaging in research—organizations mentioned political mobilization and campaigns in many of their explanations of their research and public education work.

This division of contentiousness is by no means perfect. As seen in the case of China in the previous chapter, education INGOs can pose a threat to regime stability as governments fear the spread of foreign influence among their youth, and development INGOs can rival weak central governments and create territorial "fiefdoms" to supersede the regime [@Schuller:2012]. However, while the division between low and high contention issues is fairly simplistic, it does appear to accurately capture (1) the broad types of programs that INGOs engage in, and (2) the range of possible objections governments are likely to raise (or not raise).


### Mission

Deeper principles (from free response questions)

### Flexibility

Differences in instrumental approaches, operational flexibility

How operate

Size, volunteers, money, etc. = show how NGOs differ across groups or types of issues

What they do in country - Q4.3

Time in country


### Relationship with the government

Relationships with governments - how essential or in line are these organizations with government needs?

## INGO restrictions

I then describe how restricted these organizations feel in their target countries and explore factors that are associated with those feelings of restriction, based on an organization's mission, flexibility, and relationship with the government. 

Restriction ~ instrumental issues + issue alignment + principles


How restricted do they feel? How is that related to mission, flexibility, relationship with government?

---- 

### Relationship with host governments

In general, how positive are NGO relationships with their hosts? (Q4.11) - depends on regime type? issue? principles? flexibility?
Stories from free responses

Government views of NGOs -
Threat to government - fear of gatherings - bigger NGOs a threat?
Government wants to use NGOs
Bribery
Domestic politics

Are organizations registered? More/less likely to be registered in democracies
Stories from free responses

Contact with government - based on feeling of restriction and positivity of relationship with government - organizations that are more restricted/more positive are more/less in contact with government - who do INGOs contact? presidents, MPs, etc (Q4.7) - are they required to have someone on their board(Q4.9) - how often do they report?
Stories from free responses

### Government involvement in and regulation of NGO programming

How is the government involved? Q4.10

The most common way for the government affect NGO work is through regulation How do government restrict and regulate NGOs? How are NGOs affected by those regulations?

NGOs are fairly familiar with the regulations they face (Q4.13–15)

How restrictive are these regulations (Q4.17)? What does the lived experience look like? (Q4.16)? Different depending on regime type? Issue? Principles?

Key themes emerge from the rich free response questions:

Importance of enabling environment
rules have to be followed - but if there's no enabling environment, it's really hard to do anything - 1412\_4.10 - provide security in Somalia - 1683\_4.10 - collaborate

Registration
Arbitrary - confusing
lengthy - 4 years in Haiti - multiple years in Congo
caused delays - slowdowns
hurts organizations
Can't build offices
Easier in EU, west

Operations
Locked into programs
Regulations give government control sometimes

Advocacy
Self-censorship, fear of crossing the line

Assembly
Organizations are kind of resigned to this
Unfounded fears of foreign influence
Arbitrary denial
Arrests
Apply for permission

Funding
Lots in 16f
Disclose sources of funding

Unrelated
Taxes, fees, bureaucratic regulations, irrational visa restrictions


How do all these regulations affect the ability to pursue mission? Q4.18


## What about those that don't feel regulated?

The experiences of these NGOs paints a dire picture of BLAH BLAH. However, X% of respondents indicated feeling little to no restrictions in their host countries? Why is that?

Regime type - responses saying all is well work in the EU and US
Contentiousness - those more in line with government preferences aren't restricted as much

## Responses to restrictions

organization size:

> Sarah Bush says larger more professional organizations have tamer programs
> I find that larger organizations can be more resilient in authoritarian contexts. But at what cost? They can shift resources around, but they have to shift closer to the regime?

I then describe how INGOs have reacted to changing restrictions and consider what factors are correlated with which types of reactions. 


Reaction ~ instrumental issues + issue alignment + principles

Responses to reactions - how have they responded + are these responses associated with contentiousness, instrumental stuff, core principles, or alignment with government?

We changed the sources of our funding
We changed which issues we work on
We changed how we communicate with the government
We changed how we communicate with our donors
We changed which locations we work in
We changed the location of our country office
We used more local staff and/or volunteers
We used more foreign staff and/or volunteers


Do types of restriction (Q4.16) or general level of restriction (Q4.17) correlate with responses to regulations (Q4.21)?

\\# of changes ~ feeling of restriction + instrumental stuff + relationship with government

> ¿Total change count in reactions to government restrictions?

---- 

## Reactions

- Ways around registration - 16a: 1693, 1699
- Smaller programs
- Fund irregularly
- Fund through government
- Shape programming to fit regulations
- Just follow rules
- Align with government
- Partner with government (but that's hard)
- Work with consultants
- Work in exile
- Collaborate with domestic NGOs
- Protect against changes
- Work regardless of registration status
- Avoid fees
- Bribery
- Leave the country

## Sandbox

More restrictions ~ collaborations?
Reactions to restrictions ~ collaborations

Differences in instrumental flexibility by level of contentiousness?


Feeling of restriction ~ relationship with government

---- 

Feelings of restriction

Adjustments

Adjustments in programming ~ alignment/relationship with government + instrumental flexibility + principled concerns

Also, feeling of restriction ~ alignment

Which variables adjust more or first? Core or flexibility? Are NGOs protecting their core with flexibility?


## ARNOVA outline

USE IRI VS. CARNEGIE

One changed instrumental, one changed principles

Instrumental concerns - size of organization; sources of funding

Perceptions of restriction
Relationship with government

Reactions

Types of reactions

Overall percent reaction - no relationship between issue contentiousness and changes; clear relationship between regime type and changes

Case studies: AMERA vs. IRI


## Survey structure

The survey includes a series of questions designed to identify the aspects of an INGO's organizational culture that correspond to my theory. In general, I ask respondents to (1) define their organization's core mission, vision, and values, and discuss how their programming reflects those principles, (2) explain the organization's flexibility (i.e. how it raises funds, how it collaborates with other organizations, etc.), and (3) describe and discuss the government restrictions they have faced while working abroad. Ultimately, I will be able to use these results to test each of the three mechanisms and determine how, why, and when INGOs shift their core values, become more flexible and instrumental, or attempt to induce the government to change its preferences. 


Structure analysis around each element of theory. 

- summary of responses
- summary of relationship with government + restrictions + reactions to restrictions + regime type
- instrumental size funding volunteers reactions to restrictions, overall restrictions
- principles based on free responses and reactions
- issue alignment
