Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, millions of refugees have fled to neighboring countries to escape the violence. By March 2017, Turkey had registered and accepted 2.9 million Syrians as refugees , nearly 60% of the roughly 5 million that had left by then.[^1] Because this massive influx of people has placed an enormous strain on Turkish social services, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan allowed dozens of international NGOs into the country to provide humanitarian assistance. Mercy Corps, a US-based refugee assistance INGO, set up offices in southern Turkey in 2012 and quickly became one of the most prominent INGOs to help with the relief effort, providing humanitarian assistance, education, social, and economic services to more than 100,000 Syrian refugees in 2016 alone. In March 2017, however, the Turkish government revoked Mercy Corps' registration due to a vague technicality. The INGO rapidly shuttered its offices, laid off 20 Turkish staff, and left the country, leaving hundreds of thousands of refugees in a lurch.[^2] Turkey had been swept up in the growing global wave of authoritarian crackdowns on international NGOs.

In 2015, James Savage, the director of Amnesty International's Human Rights Defenders Programme noted with dismay:

> This global wave of restrictions has a rapidity and breadth to its spread we've not seen before, that arguably represents a seismic shift and closing down of human rights space not seen in a generation. There are new pieces of legislation almost every week—on foreign funding, restrictions in registration or association, anti-protest laws, gagging laws. And, unquestionably, this is going to intensify in the coming two to three years. You can visibly watch the space shrinking.[^3]

So far, Savage has been right. Civic space is indeed shrinking. As seen in this dissertation, Egypt, Russia, and China have all imposed strict regulations on international NGOs working in their countries. Dozens of other countries, including Azerbaijan, Cambodia, India, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uganda have all passed or are in the process of passing similarly restrictive laws.

In spite of this global shrinking of civic space, INGOs continue to work in these restrictive countries. 

This is the puzzle I've been investigating

The global crackdown on civic space and INGOs' subsequent adaptation presents a fascinating puzzle. Though the services and advocacy provided by INGOs can challenge the legitimacy and power of the regime, autocratic states allow many INGO activities, and INGOs in turn continue to work in these countries in spite of the heavy legal restrictions. In this dissertation, I theorize that the relationship between INGOs and autocrats creates a state of *amicable contempt*, where each party is aware that the other both threatens and supports their existence.

Autocrats see global civil society as a strategic player in their domestic political landscape. International NGOs can help autocrats maintain regime stability and remain in power by providing services and expertise, bestowing a sheen of international legitimacy and reputation, and offset domestic institutional challenges. At the same time, though, INGOs pose a risk to autocrats. Their missions and goals might conflict with the regime—for instance, a human rights INGO might condemn a leader who relies on torture to control dissidents. To address this dilemma, autocrats use specific and careful strategies for enjoying the political, social, and other practical benefits of INGOs while simultaneously offsetting the costs and risks of letting these organizations operate in their country. One of their primary methods for controlling INGOs is through regulation and restriction.

International NGOs understand this contentious relationship with their host countries and work to adjust and adapt to the political environment. Parallel to the cost-benefit calculus of their host governments, INGOs seek to balance their need to pursue their work (often in opposition to the regime) against the risk of acting as a political pawn of the regime and propping it up. Rather than passively accepting the regulatory environment imposed on them, INGOs work to either shape that environment or adjust their programs and strategies to maintain access to the country.

Anti-NGO regulations are increasing worldwide and the space for civic space and associational life is contracting. But these new regulations have not ended global civil society, nor will they—autocrats will continue to benefit from NGOs, and NGOs will continue to adjust creatively to remain attractive and active. 

In this complicated state of amicable contempt, with both parties reacting and adjusting, who wins? When can regimes reap the benefits of INGO programming? What determines whether an INGO can avoid co-optation *and* remain actively engaged in a country? How do INGOs adapt? And how does this adaptation affect their strategies? Does it fundamentally change the organizations themselves, and can autocrats keep the upper hand?

## Objections

Objections - flexibility is too broad a term. Organizations respond similarly to gatekeeping and capture regulations ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Potential threat to all of this = survivorship bias

## Future work

Reputational effect was unsatisfactory. The event data measure is too broad and doesn't and doesn't capture any positive or negative effect. Case studies reveals contradicting evidence as well. There may be something to the story of reputation, though. CIVICUS index might be a fruitful avenue. New research by Judith Kelley shows how countries use scorecards and ratings and grades to encourage political reform with human trafficking, and work by Judith Kelley and Beth Simmons looks at a more aggregate effect of ratings, collecting information on more than 180 different indexes. Following in this vein, in 2016 CIVICUS launched a project to quantitatively rate closing civic space around the world. If this continues, it could be helpful.

### Flexibility and strategic management

Management scholar Henry Mintzberg notes a difference between deliberate strategies, where organizations lay down careful plans and goals and objectives, and emergent strategies, where organizations achieve unplanned strategies unintentionally [@MintzbergWalters:1985]. Though emergent strategy appears haphazard, conjuring notions of organizations fumbling with no long-term vision, its implications are more subtle. Mintzberg recommends that rather than spend considerable time trying to anticipate all possible future changes, organizations should try to react quickly to changes on the ground and adjust their strategies accordingly. For instance, Spanish clothing retailer Zara uses just-in-time inventory control to react to emerging fashion trends—rather than keep warehouses full of preplanned styles, analysts keep track of which clothing items sell the most and which new styles are most popular, and shift their stores' inventories on the fly [@Watts:2011, 187].  Zara can only restock its inventories with new styles because of a wide network of small factories located near its storefronts. In order to take advantage of emergent strategy, organizations require a substantial amount of flexibility to make rapid changes and shift resources around.

Some of the principles of emergent strategy can be usefully applied to international NGOs working in authoritarian contexts. Flexibility is an essential components of an INGO's response to government regulations. When facing gatekeeping regulations, INGOs rely on their flexibility to creatively work around laws, seeking out the friendliest bureaucrats and government ministries, moving their headquarters to more remote parts of the country, employing local staff, or working from abroad. When changes to the regulatory environment occur, INGOs with the most flexibility have been the most likely to either remain in the country or to continue their operations from exile. 

The importance of flexibility is even more visible when comparing the experiences of AMERA and IRI. Both organizations worked in Egypt, and both were forced out because of government intervention. Despite having worked in the country for nearly a decade with dozens of local Egyptian employees, volunteers, and interns, AMERA was unable to shift its limited resources around and quickly adapt to the changing regulatory environment. Uneven revenue from foundation sources, coupled with a temporary loss of Comic Relief funding, put immense financial strain on the organization. Additionally, AMERA could not move its staff and operations to a neighboring country—its work was based entirely in Egypt, and it had no other offices to turn to. Its Uganda subsidiary had become independent years before, and its new partnerships in Cameroon and Morocco were still in their infancy. In the absence of flexibility, AMERA turned over its programming to the Egyptian Foundation for Refugee Rights, returned to London, shed its staff, and restructured itself. 

IRI, on the other hand, enjoyed immense amounts of flexibility, with millions of dollars in grants from the US State Department, USAID, and the NED. It also had field offices in dozens of countries throughout the world, and offered a diverse portfolio of democracy promotion programs, ranging from election monitoring to candidate training. After the December 2011 raids on INGO offices in Egypt, IRI was able to quickly relocate its staff to neighboring countries and reestablish its Egyptian operations from abroad. Moreover, the organization enlisted the help of the US government to evacuate staff that sought asylum in the US embassy. IRI's flexibility allowed it to protect itself from government attempts at public relations program capture, and while IRI staff note that leaving the country did reduce the effectiveness of some of their programs, the organization has continued working with Egyptians from its regional and DC offices.

Article 19 takes an approach similar to IRI, but on a much smaller scale. By relying on government grants and establishing a handful of regional offices, Article 19 has been able to maintain a nearly global reach since its decision to spread out of its London headquarters in 2006–07. By collaborating in networks of other freedom of expression INGOs, it has built up partnerships with activists and government officials which have allowed it to respond quickly to changes in political contexts. When Article 19 joined IFEX's Tunisia Monitoring Group in 2005, it could not have foreseen the 2011 overthrow of President Ben ʿAli. Immediately after the Tunisian uprising, Article 19 relied on the connections it had fostered during its partnership with IFEX-TMG and quickly set up a regional office. The organization's physical presence, in turn, allowed it to gain access to legislative debates and provide advice on freedom of expression and association laws. It can also provide training, advice, and advocacy to countries like Egypt where it cannot establish formal offices because of severe gatekeeping regulations. The organization's flexibility allows it to successfully maneuver in dynamic regulatory environments. 

Index on Censorship provides a different example of relying on flexibility to rapidly respond to changes. Unlike IRI, AMERA, and Article 19, Index purposely does not establish field offices—maintaining physical presence in its target countries is explicitly not part of their strategy. Instead Index relies on a network of freelance journalists and human rights activists to gather information, conduct research, lobby governments, and advocate for freedom of expression rights. It selects 2–3 focus countries every year as its primary targets for advocacy and lobbying, but it is also able to send local freelancers to respond to unexpected crises, arrests, or instances of censorship. The organization's constant flow of revenue from foundation grants and magazine sales provides it with financial stability, which in turn allows it to quickly address pressing freedom of expression issues, all while avoiding government regulations. 

Flexibility is thus essential to be able to quickly and strategically respond to anti-NGO gatekeeping and program capture regulations. Given these INGOs' experiences, it appears that the best advice for INGOs facing crackdown is to have substantial revenue, a large staff, a network of regional offices, and close connections with US ambassadors. However, such a suggestion is wildly impractical. Not all INGOs are as big as IRI, or even as big as Article 19—in the global survey of INGOs, respondents had a median of 8 employees, 20% respondents only work in one other country besides their home, and small private donations were the most commonly reported revenue stream. Likewise, not all INGOs *should* be as big as IRI. Small organizations like AMERA built up an extensive network of refugee advocates and service providers because it only worked in one other country.

### Is it better to be bigger?

The importance of instrumental flexibility in responding to government regulation raises an important question and potentially conflicts with research by Sarah Bush [-@Bush:2015]. Bush finds that NGOs that receive funding from the NED and other large donors adjust their programs to meed donor demands. In particular, in conjunction with a measurability revolution in the international development and democracy promotion world, NGOs are encouraged to quantify their inputs, outputs, and outcomes to facilitate donor-run statistical evaluations, and to meet these more complicated demands, recipient NGOs hire more staff with professional MPA and MPP degrees. As a result of this growing focus on measurability, Bush shows that democracy promotion NGOs are hesitant to engage in non-measurable programs or conduct advocacy that could jeopardize its access to the country. Fears of losing NED funding—either because its programs yield no measurable results, or because pursuing contentious programming leads to expulsion from the country—have thus led to a taming of democracy promotion activities. To reverse this trend towards taming, Bush suggests that NGOs seek out smaller and more nimble donors who impose fewer operational requirements. Additionally, donors should seek out smaller, more observable, and more controllable recipient NGOs [@Bush:2015, 228–29]. Bush concludes that smaller donors and smaller NGOs are more competitive, more responsive and more efficient.

Bush's suggestions to un-tame democracy assistance stand in stark contrast with the experiences of Article 19, IRI, and other larger INGOs that were able to successfully adapt to changing government regulations. Working in repressive regimes is difficult and requires immense amounts of flexibility to effectively combat government attempts at gatekeeping and capture. In the absence of substantial funding and flexibility, INGO programming either becomes tame, or, like AMERA, INGOs shut down. Funding from large organizations like the NED, USAID, DFID, the OSCE, and others have enabled besieged INGOs to protect their core missions, thus avoiding the very taming identified by Bush. 

We can reconcile these seemingly conflicting recommendations 

Funding is not the only source of flexibility 

Though IRI and Article 19 enjoy sizable government funding, they have had to content with the measurability revolution. Recall the Article 19 staffer's complaint that the Polish Solidarity movement would not have succeeded today because donors are overly focused on measurable outcomes and results.[^4] IRI noted similar issues with donor inflexibility, explaining that it generally found it easier to work on NED- and USAID-sponsored projects than projects funded by the State Department because they faced fewer restrictions on their programs and could shift priorities around without obtaining donor permission first—IRI was able to close its office in Russia in 2012 because of flexible project contract terms.[^5]  Other organizations have faced similar flexibility-related hurdles from their donors. Several years after the Arab Spring uprisings, one human rights INGO that had supported Middle Eastern activists faced an audit from one of its larger funders and was penalized for not maintaining receipts or documentation of their activities in the early days of the uprising—an impossible feat given that the banking system had shut down amidst the political upheaval, rioting, and repression.[^6]

TODO: something about flexibility

Finally, in some cases, taming INGO programming and not confronting dictators might not be the worst outcome—taming can be strategic and necessary. Greenpeace is one of the only environmental INGOs working in China, but to gain access to the country, it needed to undertake significant changes in its strategy and ratchet down the contentiousness of its China-based programs. Following the theoretical model, the organization appeared to have been captured by the regime, with its core mission shifting closer to government preferences. However, Greenpeace's taming was deliberate. Their goal was not to take on the government and shame it into action—it was to "help a billion people in one country with severe environmental issues."[^7] The Carnegie Center in Moscow also apparently realigned itself with Putin's preferences, taming its mission to be more friendly with the regime. However, it is also now the only American think tank in Russia, and is therefore well positioned to take advantage of any potential future openings in civic space. More importantly, though, it is a research institution and does not have an explicit goal to confront the regime. "Think tanks don't have to change the world,"[^8] and neither do many other types of INGOs. 

### Lessons for INGOs

So what should INGOs do?

In the end, the policy prescription is similar: give INGOs space and resources, don't overemphasize funding 

Be aware of factors that influence CSRE - watch for internal political conflict and regional conflicts - pay attention to which countries are shameable - are susceptible to/concerned with shaming and international reputation. 7 Index award winners have been in China—the next most frequent recipient home countries = 4. Of the countries analyzed in chapter 3, China cares the most about its reputation.

USAID:2014

Before facing restrictions,

- Safeguarding space is a long-term effort
- Monitor and track the legal enabling environment
- Cultivate domestic philanthropy abroad - wean local NGOs off of foreign funding
- Early action - In a poli cal transi on, there are many poten al issues for a new government to tackle. Past experience has proven that early engagement on improving the CSO enabling environment during these early windows of opportunity can be cri cal and will lay a long-term founda on for a strong civil society.
- Find champions in government and legislature
- Empower local voices
- Engage at multiple levels with key officials


When facing restrictions,

- Consider work arounds
- Lessen the compliance burden for CSOs - BUT
- USAID is complicit, though: With increased regulation by governments, USAID, USG want partners to play ball, to follow regulations, to get registered, as well they should—this is a good thing - except in certain cases where you have a host government that's using these regulations to gum up the works - like Pakistan - practical effect is that their reforms are bringing things to a halt - USAID is complicit in this by saying that they're only interested in projects undertaken by organizations that register, etc.
- Keep diplomatic pressure sustained

# "Doing all we can to help civil society succeed"

Civic space is closing around the world, given that it has become a useful addition to dictators' toolkits for managing institutional challenges, the trend in repression is unlikely to reverse. 

INGOs are adapting to this repressive new environment, though. Policymakers and donors should ensure that they assist besieged INGOs. During his 2013 civil society roundtable, President Obama called for new commitments to help civil society succeed under repressive circumstances:

> We have to find new and better ways to support civil society in difficult circumstances. Governments that restrict civil society are sharing their worst practices. We've got to make sure that we're sharing our best practices and doing all we can to help civil society succeed. [@Obama:2013]

So yeah, let's do that. :)
