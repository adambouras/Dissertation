Since the beginning of the Syrian civil war in 2011, millions of refugees have fled to neighboring countries to escape the violence. By March 2017, Turkey had registered and accepted 2.9 million Syrians as refugees, nearly 60% of the roughly 5 million that had left by then.[^1] Because this massive influx of people has placed an enormous strain on Turkish social services, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan allowed dozens of international NGOs into the country to provide humanitarian assistance. Mercy Corps, a US-based refugee assistance INGO, set up offices in southern Turkey in 2012 and quickly became one of the most prominent INGOs to help with the relief effort, providing humanitarian assistance, education, social, and economic services to more than 100,000 Syrian refugees in 2016 alone. In March 2017, however, the Turkish government revoked Mercy Corps' registration due to a vague technicality. The INGO rapidly shuttered its offices, laid off 20 Turkish staff, and left the country, leaving hundreds of thousands of refugees in a lurch.[^2] Turkey had been swept up in the apparently growing global wave of authoritarian crackdowns on international NGOs.

In 2015, James Savage, the director of Amnesty International's Human Rights Defenders Programme noted with dismay:

> This global wave of restrictions has a rapidity and breadth to its spread we've not seen before, that arguably represents a seismic shift and closing down of human rights space not seen in a generation. There are new pieces of legislation almost every week—on foreign funding, restrictions in registration or association, anti-protest laws, gagging laws. And, unquestionably, this is going to intensify in the coming two to three years. You can visibly watch the space shrinking.[^3]

So far, Savage has been right. Civic space is indeed shrinking. As I have shown in this dissertation, Egypt, Russia, and China have all imposed strict regulations on international NGOs working in their countries. Dozens of other countries, including Cambodia, India, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Myanmar, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Uganda have all passed or are in the process of passing similarly restrictive laws.

In spite of this global closing of civic space, international NGOs continue to work in these restrictive countries and make creative adjustments to their programs in order to remain effective. Though it has been expelled from Egypt twice and its employees were subject to a widely televised public trial, IRI has continued its democracy promotion programming in Egypt from abroad. Index on Censorship criticizes and antagonizes governments that infringe on freedom of expression rights, targeting countries with some of the most restrictive anti-NGO laws, like Azerbaijan. Article 19 moved into the Middle East shortly after the 2011 Arab Spring in an attempt to preemptively shape the legal environment for INGOs before it became restricted. Closing civic space has not put an end to INGO advocacy.

In this dissertation, I have argued that the relationship between INGOs and autocrats creates a state of *amicable contempt*, where each party is aware that the other both threatens and supports their existence. Autocrats see global civil society as a strategic player in their domestic political landscape. International NGOs can help autocrats maintain regime stability and remain in power by providing services and expertise, bestowing international legitimacy and reputation, and offsetting domestic institutional challenges. At the same time, though, INGOs pose a risk to autocrats, since their goals and programs can conflict with regime preferences. To address this dilemma, autocrats use gatekeeping and program capture regulations to expand and constrict the allowable space for global civil society activity, allowing them to enjoy the practical benefits of INGOs while simultaneously mitigating the risk of letting these organizations operate in their country. International NGOs understand this contentious relationship with their host countries and adapt to the political environment. Instead of passively accepting the regulatory environment imposed on them, INGOs work to either shape that environment or adjust their programs and strategies to maintain access to the country.

# Summary of the argument

At the beginning of this dissertation, I posed a series of questions: Why do regimes allow INGOs to work in their country? What influences INGO decision making in restrictive environments? How do regimes reap the benefits of INGO programming? How do INGOs adapt to restrictions? I briefly examine how the statistical, survey, and case study evidence has answered these questions.

The theory of amicable contempt
</div>

## Why do regimes allow INGOs to work in their country?

Autocrats maintain power and stability by balancing a host of institutional challengers. Dictators co-opt and control pseudo-democratic domestic institutions, such as legislatures, judiciaries, elections, and even popular protests, to enhance regime stability. The statistical model in chapter 2 and the case studies of Egypt, Russia, and China in chapter 3 demonstrate that civil society—and international NGOs in particular—fit into authoritarian stability-seeking calculus. Dictators must carefully balance and contend with international NGOs, maximizing the optimum level of foreign-based advocacy in their countries without causing domestic instability.

Regimes harness the stability-enhancing benefits of international NGOs by creating regulations to manage and limit their in-country activities. Governments establish de jure legal regulations to prevent INGO programming from going beyond the regime's ideal point. This statutory level of advocacy is not followed strictly, though, and regimes rely on enormous amount of discretion in actually implementing those laws. In the beginning of this dissertation, I explored my first general hypothesis: *when authoritarian regimes perceive themselves to be more stable, they can risk expanding their regulatory environments and allow for more dissonance,* or, stated differently, that regimes can afford to employ more discretion and leniency when they are stable and have balanced out other institutional challengers. @fig:summary-regime-effects shows how three factors influence a regime's civil society regulatory environment (CSRE). 

The evidence has shown that internal concerns of over domestic instability are associated with a worse and more constricted CSRE, as autocrats retrench and limit institutional dissonance. The evidence also shows that the CSRE worsens as regimes become more consolidated and cohesive, suggesting that autocrats allow for (or ignore) civil society while they balance out other more pressing economic and political challenges, and that they eventually get around to addressing civil society later. However, domestic crises can accelerate a regime's turn against civil society. In Egypt, both SCAF and Morsi held off from regulating civil society until popular protests and domestic terror attacks led to late night raids and public trials of INGOs. Between 2015–17, the CCP reversed its marginal transition away from its discretionary relationship with INGOs in the face of economic recession, popular protests, and domestic unrest and violence grew. Evidence from the case studies suggests that concerns over external instability and encroachments on sovereignty help determine the size of an autocrat's CSRE. In Russia, Putin invoked notions of *gosudarstvennost* and reduced the allowable space for civil society in an effort to protect his regime's sovereignty from foreign pressures. China was also concerned with Western influence in politics, economics and society, and its 2017 Overseas NGO law was designed to curb this influence. 

Finally, regimes may be influenced by reputational concerns when regulating INGOs. However, the evidence for this hypothesis was unsatisfactory. The statistical measure I used in chapter 2 was too broad and failed to capture any positive or negative effect. The case studies in chapter 3 reveal contradicting evidence, as well—Russia rebuffed diplomatic efforts to cajole it into showing more openness to international NGOs, and China passed strict anti-INGO legislation despite international condemnation. Though there is insufficient evidence here, there may be something to the story of reputation. Research by Judith Kelley and Beth Simmons demonstrates how countries use scorecards, ratings, and grades to encourage political reforms in other countries [@Kelley:2017; @KelleySimmons:2015]. Following in this vein, CIVICUS launched its Monitor project in 2015 in an attempt to quantitatively measure, track, and rate the phenomenon of closing space, categorizing countries' civic environments as closed, repressed, obstructed, narrowed, or open.[^4] If the CIVICUS Monitor continues to be updated, it could provide a fruitful avenue for looking more closely at the effect of international shaming specifically on a country's civil society restrictions.

## What influences INGO decision making in restrictive environments?

In chapter 4, I explored how INGOs face their own balancing dilemma. Instead of maintaining appropriate levels of dissonance among rival political actors, INGOs must balance their normative mission-driven principles against the instrumental needs of organizational survival. I use evidence from a global survey of INGOs to show how INGOs are motivated primarily by their foundational mission and values, and how these organizations structure their strategies around this vision to ensure that their programming furthers their mission. At the same time, INGOs must balance the need to pursue their missions with the need to obtain resources to pay for those missions. Worries about money, fundraising, staff training, and other resources can get in the way of pursuing deeper normative principles and constrain INGO missions. Focusing on instrumental concerns enables organizations to carry out their missions in the first place and a reserve of programmatic flexibility provides INGOs with a protective margin around their core missions, subsequently enabling INGOs to respond to government regulations in constrained regulatory environments.

## How do regimes reap the benefits of INGO programming?

In chapters 5 and 6, I explored my second and third general hypotheses: *when authoritarian regimes perceive INGO programming as threatening, they will limit the practical operating environment by reducing INGO flexibility* and *when authoritarian regimes perceive INGO programming as potentially beneficial, they will attempt to move the INGO's ideal point closer to regime preferences by targeting INGO missions.* Each of these arguments correspond to different forms of INGO regulations that autocrats rely on to (1) prevent INGOs from adversely influencing their institutional balance, and (2) to reap the benefits of their programs (see @fig:summary-regulation-purpose). Evidence from the global survey of INGOs and from INGO case studies shows that regimes rely on gatekeeping regulations—including entry, registration, and programming restrictions—to reduce INGO flexibility and make it difficult to continue working in the country. Restrictions on registration and programs are defensive and designed to filter out organizations before they enter the country and limit the scope of their activities once they are in the country.

I also provide evidence that regimes can be more proactive, rather than defensive, and attempt to take advantage of INGO services by implementing regulations designed to capture, co-opt, and coerce changes in INGO missions, bringing them into closer alignment with regime preferences. Restrictions on resources (including foreign funding) and rules governing the management of guest INGOs give governments some degree of control over INGO strategies. Additionally, I show that governments can distort INGO missions by capturing their services for public relations purposes, either by praising their guest INGOs and holding them up as a sign of compliance with international norms, or by using INGOs as a scapegoat and proof of foreign conspiracies.

## How do INGOs adapt to restrictions?

Finally, I used case study and survey evidence to show how INGOs adapt their strategies to each of these types of restrictions, relying on their reserves of programmatic flexibility to protect changes in their core missions. When confronting gatekeeping regulations, INGOs are primarily concerned with maintaining access to the country. An INGO's level of contentiousness determines the level of gatekeeping pressure they face. Contentious organizations face higher scrutiny as regimes attempt to limit their access to the country, head off potential political threats, and make the practical operating environment more difficult. In response, organizations that enjoy greater programmatic flexibility can make creative adjustments on the margins of their missions to adapt to these laws. Results from the survey show how INGOs find creative workarounds to registration and programmatic laws, partnering with friendly government officials, training activists from abroad, and dividing up larger programs to avoid attracting too much government attention. The case of Article 19 shows how the organization has confronted gatekeeping regulations by relying on its budget, its diverse portfolio of programs, its relationships with activists and host government officials, and its network of regional offices to maximize its theoretical overlap with regime preferences and remain active and effective.

Organizations with less flexibility, on the other hand, are less likely to be able to adjust to the operating environment and can be forced to maintain a low profile and avoid contact with the government, or cease their work and exit the country. In the case of AMERA, post-revolutionary politics and unrest led to a constriction of the civil society regulatory environment, and, unable to adapt to stricter gatekeeping requirements in the absence of substantial flexibility, the organization left the country. Evidence from the survey also showed that smaller, poorly funded INGOs will hide from the government, but  doing so makes their programs less efficient, since "if [they] grow big enough … [they] can no longer fly under the radar."[^5]

On the other hand, when facing program capture restrictions, INGOs are concerned primarily with protecting against changes to their core missions and ensure that complying with those regulations does not conflict with their values. Organizations with high programmatic flexibility will be able to resist or adjust to government attempts at co-optation while continuing their programming with minimal changes. Survey responses were replete with examples of how INGOs have drawn on their flexibility to protect their core missions and prevent government capture. For instance, some have skirted foreign funding regulations by adjusting how they send money to their target country offices, wiring smaller amounts more frequently to avoid government scrutiny, while others have relocated their in-country offices to escape overbearing local officials that had demanded increased managerial oversight. The cases of IRI and Index on Censorship both demonstrate how INGOs can avoid public relations capture. Both organizations use their substantial incomes and collaborative partnerships to lobby and advocate against repressive regimes without playing into regime demands. 

Organizations with less flexibility, however, are more likely to concede to the regime and align their programs with government preferences. Many small, low contention survey respondents reported that they had changed their funding structure to allow for increased government control, turning to government-sanctioned sources of funding and funneling foreign donations through requisite government agencies. Instead of fighting against regulations, many low flexibility organizations reluctantly comply capture regulations along in pursuit of their mission.

# Theoretical contributions

At the end of the introduction, I set out to build a middle-range theory

Stuff about nuance, etc.

The findings here serve to build and develop a theory of INGO-dictator relations. Due to a paucity of data, however, I did not test specific elements of the theory. 

Hypotheses were slightly wonky, worked differently than I had thought. That was okay, but it meant that the case studies were focused on model building and exploration instead of testing. Similarly, due to the nature of researching a broad range of international NGOs, the survey data was based on a random sample of organizations and the results, therefore, are not completely representative of the INGO world as a whole. As such, data from the survey once again serves to help with model building rather than testing.

Despite the explicit lack of model testing, the evidence from the statistical analysis, case studies, and global survey of INGOs makes a case for a more robust model of amicable contempt.

Additionally, the evidence presented here deepens our understanding of multiple existing political science and nonprofit management theories.




 the findings here serve to build and develop (and not test) a theory of INGO-dictator relations.

# Future research

Timur raised a fascinating point about an interesting possible strategy for regulating NGOs—a country might encourage their peers and neighbors to regulate the INGOs within *their* borders as a strategy for mitigating the threat of INGOs in its own country. Given that previous research has found that INGOs tend to flock to countries with the friendliest regulations in a region [@citeme], more recalcitrant countries may encourage their peers to impose harsher regulations on INGOs in an effort to deny these organizations a regional safe haven.

Article 19 did this. I am unaware if larger, more powerful countries like Egypt, China, or Russia have worked to convince their neighbors to tighten controls on INGOs, but future research is needed. 

There is also a possibility of regional influence in the opposite direction, with countries purposely adopting laws similar to those passed in their more powerful neighbors. For instance, since the passage of the 2012 and 2015 anti-NGO laws in Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan have passed similar regulations, modeled in part on Russia's original legislation. Similarly, in 2017 Jordan began applying its anti-terror laws to civil society organizations, following Egypt's lead. Authoritarian learning and diffusion may lie beneath the phenomenon of the global crackdown on civil society, as regimes notice, copy, and adapt the regulatory strategies of their peers.

# Lessons learned

One of the key takeaways from this research is that flexibility is essential for INGOs to successfully adapt to both programming and program capture restrictions. I conclude with three final observations about the importance of INGO flexibility.

## Flexibility and strategic management

Management scholar Henry Mintzberg notes a difference between deliberate strategies, where organizations lay down careful plans and goals and objectives; and emergent strategies, where organizations achieve unplanned strategies unintentionally [@MintzbergWalters:1985]. Though emergent strategy appears haphazard, conjuring notions of organizations fumbling with no long-term vision, its implications are more subtle. Mintzberg recommends that rather than spend considerable time trying to anticipate all possible future changes, organizations should try to react quickly to changes on the ground and adjust their strategies accordingly. For instance, Spanish clothing retailer Zara uses just-in-time inventory control to react to emerging fashion trends—rather than keep warehouses full of preplanned styles, analysts keep track of which clothing items sell the most and which new styles are most popular, and shift their stores' inventories on the fly [@Watts:2011, 187].  Zara can only restock its inventories with new styles because of a wide network of small factories located near its storefronts. In order to take advantage of emergent strategy, organizations require a substantial amount of flexibility to make rapid changes and shift resources around.

Some of the principles of emergent strategy can be usefully applied to international NGOs working in authoritarian contexts. Flexibility is an essential component of an INGO's response to government regulations. When facing gatekeeping regulations, INGOs rely on their flexibility to creatively work around laws, seeking out the friendliest bureaucrats and government ministries, moving their headquarters to more remote parts of the country, employing local staff, or working from abroad. When changes to the regulatory environment occur, INGOs with the most flexibility have been the most likely to either remain in the country or to continue their operations from exile. 

The importance of flexibility is even more visible when comparing the experiences of AMERA and IRI. Both organizations worked in Egypt, and both were forced out because of government intervention. Despite having worked in the country for nearly a decade with dozens of local Egyptian employees, volunteers, and interns, AMERA was unable to shift its limited resources around in order to quickly adapt to the changing regulatory environment. Uneven revenue from foundation sources, coupled with a temporary loss of Comic Relief funding, put immense financial strain on the organization. Additionally, AMERA could not move its staff and operations to a neighboring country—its work was based entirely in Egypt, and it had no other offices to turn to. Its Uganda subsidiary had become independent years before, and its new partnerships in Cameroon and Morocco were still in their infancy. In the absence of flexibility, AMERA turned over its programming to the Egyptian Foundation for Refugee Rights, returned to London, shed its staff, and restructured itself. 

IRI, on the other hand, enjoyed immense amounts of flexibility, with millions of dollars in grants from the US State Department, USAID, and the NED. Its field offices, located in dozens of countries throughout the world, allowed the organization to offer a diverse portfolio of democracy promotion programs, ranging from election monitoring to candidate training. After the December 2011 raids on INGO offices in Egypt, IRI was able to quickly relocate its staff to neighboring countries and reestablish its Egyptian operations from abroad. Moreover, the organization enlisted the help of the US government to evacuate staff that sought asylum in the US embassy. IRI's flexibility allowed it to protect itself from government attempts at public relations program capture, and while IRI staff note that leaving the country did reduce the effectiveness of some of their programs, the organization has continued working with Egyptians from its regional and DC offices.

Article 19 takes an approach similar to IRI, but on a much smaller scale. By relying on government grants and establishing a handful of regional offices, Article 19 has been able to maintain a nearly global reach since its decision to spread out of its London headquarters in 2006–07. By participating in networks of other freedom of expression INGOs, it has built up partnerships with activists and government officials, allowing it to respond quickly to changes in political contexts. When Article 19 joined IFEX's Tunisia Monitoring Group in 2005, it could not have foreseen the 2011 overthrow of President Ben ʿAli. Immediately after the Tunisian uprising, Article 19 relied on the connections it had fostered during its partnership with IFEX-TMG and quickly set up a regional office. The organization's physical presence in turn allowed it to gain access to legislative debates and provide advice on freedom of expression and association laws. It can also provide training, advice, and advocacy to countries like Egypt where it cannot establish formal offices because of severe gatekeeping regulations. The organization's flexibility allows it to successfully maneuver in dynamic regulatory environments. 

Index on Censorship provides a different example of relying on flexibility to rapidly respond to changes. Unlike IRI, AMERA, and Article 19, Index purposely does not establish field offices—maintaining physical presence in its target countries is explicitly not part of their strategy. Instead Index relies on a network of freelance journalists and human rights activists to gather information, conduct research, lobby governments, and advocate for freedom of expression rights. It selects 2–3 focus countries every year as its primary targets for advocacy and lobbying, but it is also able to send local freelancers to respond to unexpected crises, arrests, or instances of censorship. The organization's constant flow of revenue from foundation grants and magazine sales provides it with financial stability, which in turn allows it to quickly address pressing freedom of expression issues, all while avoiding government regulations. 

Flexibility is thus essential to be able to quickly and strategically respond to anti-NGO gatekeeping and program capture regulations. Given these INGOs' experiences, it appears that the best advice for INGOs facing crackdown is to have substantial revenue, a large staff, a network of regional offices, and close connections with US ambassadors. However, such a suggestion is wildly impractical. Not all INGOs are as big as IRI, or even as big as Article 19—in the global survey of INGOs, respondents had a median of 8 employees, 20% of respondents only work in one other country besides their home, and small private donations were the most commonly reported revenue stream. Likewise, not all INGOs *should* be as big as IRI. Small organizations like AMERA built up an extensive network of refugee advocates and service providers because it only worked in one other country.

## Is it better to be bigger?

The importance of programmatic flexibility in responding to government regulation raises an important question and potentially conflicts with research by Sarah Bush [-@Bush:2015]. Bush finds that NGOs that receive funding from the NED and other large donors adjust their programs to meet donor demands. In particular, in conjunction with a measurability revolution in the international development and democracy promotion world, NGOs are encouraged to quantify their inputs, outputs, and outcomes to facilitate donor-run statistical evaluations, and to meet these more complicated demands, recipient NGOs hire more staff with professional MPA and MPP degrees. As a result of this growing focus on measurability, Bush shows that democracy promotion NGOs are hesitant to engage in non-measurable programs or conduct advocacy that could jeopardize its access to the country. Fears of losing NED funding—either because its programs yield no measurable results, or because pursuing contentious programming leads to expulsion from the country—have thus led to a taming of democracy promotion activities. To reverse this trend towards taming, Bush suggests that NGOs seek out smaller and more nimble donors who impose fewer operational requirements, and that donors should seek out smaller, more observable, and more controllable recipient NGOs [@Bush:2015, 228–29]. 

Bush's suggestions for un-taming democracy assistance at first stand in stark contrast with the experiences of Article 19, IRI, and other larger INGOs that were able to successfully adapt to changing government regulations. Working in repressive regimes is difficult and requires immense amounts of flexibility to effectively combat government attempts at gatekeeping and capture. In the absence of substantial funding from large donors, INGOs either tame their programming, or, like AMERA, shut down. Funding from large organizations like the NED, USAID, DFID, the OSCE, and others have enabled besieged INGOs to protect their core missions, thus avoiding the very taming identified by Bush. 

These recommendations—that INGOs should be smaller and rely less on grants from large donors, *and* that INGOs should be large and rely more on grants from large donors—appear fundamentally opposed. However, these suggestions are context dependent. Donors and INGOs must be more responsive to the evolving needs of their stakeholders and political shifts in their regulatory environments. For the democracy promotion establishment, smaller donors and smaller INGOs are necessary to avoid the staid bureaucracy of the largest donors. For INGOs facing government restrictions, large government grants and more field offices seem to be necessary to be able to shift resources around in response to crackdowns. In both situations, INGOs must maintain flexibility.

Even for besieged INGOs, funding from large donors—while necessary—can still be fraught with inflexibility. Though IRI and Article 19 enjoy sizable government funding, they have had to contend with the measurability revolution. Recall the Article 19 staffer's complaint that the Polish Solidarity movement would not have succeeded today because donors are overly focused on measurable outcomes and results.[^6] IRI noted issues with donor inflexibility, explaining that it generally found it easier to work on NED- and USAID-sponsored projects than projects funded by the State Department because they faced fewer restrictions on their programs and could shift priorities around without obtaining donor permission first—IRI was able to quickly close its office in Russia in 2012 because of flexible project contract terms.[^7] 

Finally, in some cases, taming INGO programming and not confronting dictators might not be an undesired outcome—taming can be strategic. Greenpeace is one of the only environmental INGOs working in China, but to gain access to the country, it needed to undertake significant changes in its strategy and ratchet down the contentiousness of its China-based programs. Following the theoretical model, the organization appeared to have been captured by the regime, with its core mission shifting closer to government preferences. However, Greenpeace's taming was deliberate. Their goal was not to take on the government and shame it into action—it was to "help a billion people in one country with severe environmental issues."[^8] The Carnegie Center in Moscow also apparently realigned itself with Putin's preferences, taming its mission to be more friendly with the regime. However, it is also now the only American think tank in Russia, and is therefore well positioned to take advantage of any potential future openings in civic space. More importantly, though, it is a research institution and does not have an explicit goal to confront the regime. "Think tanks don't have to change the world,"[^9] and neither do all types of INGOs. 

## "Doing all we can to help civil society succeed"

Anti-NGO regulations are increasing worldwide and in spite of the shrinking civic space and the contraction of associational life, INGOs are adapting to their repressive new environment. Because restricting international NGOs has become a useful addition to dictators' toolkits for managing institutional challenges, the closing space phenomenon will likely continue—autocrats will continue to try to benefit from NGOs, and NGOs will continue to adjust creatively to remain attractive and active. 

What should INGOs, governments, and donors do, then, to ensure that INGOs can adapt effectively without losing control over their core missions? I briefly sketch two suggestions based on the findings from this dissertation.

First, INGOs and donors should each *monitor domestic unrest and regime cohesiveness* in the countries they target. In a 2014 report about working in closed civic spaces, USAID suggests that organizations monitor and track the legal enabling environment and stay apprised of regulatory changes in their target countries [@usaid:2014]. Most INGOs already do this—according to the survey, only 20% of respondents indicated not being at all familiar with regulations in their target countries, and nearly half reported being very familiar. INGOs and donors should expand their monitoring efforts beyond looking just at regulations, watching for increases in domestic conflict such as protests and strikes, as well as signs of intragovernmental tensions. Evidence from the statistical models and case studies show that, in general, civic space will expand as regimes struggle to maintain cohesion and control over institutional balancing, thus opening up opportunities to influence policy, as Article 19 has done in Tunisia. By watching for potential openings in civic space, INGOs can engage in a type of emergent strategy and quickly respond to changes in the regulatory environment

Second, donors *should reduce burdens for INGO compliance* when INGOs face severe restrictions. Overly restrictive contracts and grant requirements limit how well INGOs can respond to government regulations. IRI was able to move its offices out of Russia and Egypt in 2012 because USAID funding agreements provided the organization with flexibility in how it implemented its grants. Other organizations have not been as fortunate. Several years after the Arab Spring uprisings, one human rights INGO that had supported Middle Eastern activists faced an audit from one of its larger funders and was penalized for not maintaining receipts or documentation of their activities in the early days of the uprising—an impossible feat given that the banking system had shut down amidst the political upheaval, rioting, and repression.[^10] Another INGO complained that US government donors had been inadvertently complicit in restricting INGO activities abroad.[^11] When issuing grants, donors often require that partner organizations follow all NGO-related regulations in their host countries and register with the appropriate agencies. In general, this is good, and organizations like Article 19 have used these requirements to speed up their registration processes when setting up field office. However, in cases where target governments use anti-NGO regulations to "gum up the works" and make life more difficult for INGOs, the practical effect of donors' registration mandates is that INGO programs either directly support repressive governments or come to a halt.

During his 2013 civil society roundtable, President Obama called for new commitments to help civil society succeed under repressive circumstances:

> We have to find new and better ways to support civil society in difficult circumstances. Governments that restrict civil society are sharing their worst practices. We've got to make sure that we're sharing our best practices and doing all we can to help civil society succeed [@Obama:2013].

This dissertation highlights some of these best practices, including, most crucially, the need for flexibility. Donors and policymakers should ensure that their contracts, agreements, and policies provide besieged INGOs with the space, resources, and flexibility required to confront this closing space.
