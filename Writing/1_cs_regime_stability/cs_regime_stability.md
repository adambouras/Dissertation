# The institutional dynamics of civil society in authoritarian regimes

## Civil society as a political institution

The idea of a civil society has long been salient, with commentators as early as De Tocqueville theorizing on the importance of groups of citizens that actively engage with their governments to advocate for reform, rights, change, and other services. Civil society is traditionally defined as "an agglomeration of private, voluntary organizations that have the capacity to assert the rights of individuals and groups," [@Cook:2007, 143] and is most commonly operationalized as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or organizations that operate outside of both the private and public sectors, ostensibly filling social gaps left by firms and governments [@AhmedPotter:2006, 30; see also @Hansmann:1980]. Civil society need not be explicitly political or rights-focused—any sort of association, including bowling clubs and parent/teacher associations, allows citizens to come in contact with each other, build social capital, and aggregate individual preferences [@Putnam:1994].

Given this wide range of possible civil society organizations, ranging from neighborhood book clubs to international human rights advocacy NGOs, it has been difficult to address civil society in a consistent theoretical way. To address this, I propose that we can gain significant analytic and theoretical insight into the purpose and function of civil society by analyzing the sector through an institutionalist lens. While formal institutional theory has typically been applied to more traditional institutions such as constitutions, electoral systems, legislative committee assignments, or judiciary structures, these theories can be usefully applied to non-traditional political phenomena like civil society. In particular, institutional theory allows us to see how civil society as an institution lowers transaction costs and promotes coordinated collective action against or in support of the state. 

Simply put, institutions are the collection of rules that define the parameters of social activity, or the "humanly devised constraints that shape human interactions" [@North:1990, 3]. These "rules of the game" dictate who can make decisions, which actions are allowed or prohibited, and how obedience is rewarded and disobedience punished [@Ostrom:1990, 51]. Institutions can range from formal structures like constitutions and property ownership regimes to informal social and cultural norms, practices, and traditions. Ultimately, institutions—both formal and informal—gain traction in society because they reduce the transaction costs of social and economic interaction. When players interact, they can trust that their counterparts will behave appropriately because of the rules of the underlying institutional framework.^[This trust can also be described in game theoretic terms as a state of equilibrium, where institutional arrangements structure the payoffs such that players have little incentive to move [@Weingast:1997; @Greif:2004; @Calvert:1995].] 

Treating civil society as an institution yields the greatest theoretical advantage when considering how civil society organizations and NGOs lower transaction costs by solving difficult collective action problems and public goods dilemmas. Civil society has typically been defined in one of two ways.^[Defined as "Civil Society I" and "Civil Society II" by @FoleyEdwards:1996.] The first school of thought, championed by @Putnam:1994, holds that vibrant associational life forges links that cross social boundaries—bowling clubs, parent/teacher associations, neighborhood groups, volunteer organizations, and other nonprofit groups tend to include members from multiple social strata, thereby breaking down vertical social boundaries and increasing social trust. This associational life increases civic engagement, embeds norms of reciprocity into society, and helps improve democratic governance—in other words, civil society ultimately *strengthens and bolsters* the state.^[Antonio Gramsci offers a bleaker view, arguing that civil society actually contributes to "a more subtle and sophisticated form of state power"—one that "serves as an outer perimeter of defense for a hegemonic state" [@Cook:2007, 7, 143].]

In contrast, others have argued that civil society should stand *in opposition to* the state. The deeper social connections formed by participating in associational life can allow members of these organizations to "stand up to city hall" [@Jamal:2007, 4], to pursue their community self-interests, or to help maintain moral order and social norms. In this view, civil society organizations act as watchdogs against the government (or private sector), providing members of society with a focal point for popular mobilization. While discussing the institutional foundation for public morality—norms that shape the preferences and payoffs for players in a society—Platteau argues:

> A civil society helps to back trust whenever there is a sufficient number of citizens who feel vengeful enough to work towards exposing publicly the illegal acts or malpractices of both private and state agents, and towards bringing enough pressure to sanction them even though such actions entail significant costs to themselves (by denouncing economic crimes they produce a public good) [@Platteau:2000, 308].

@Weingast:1997 provides a more general explanation of how civil society's denouncement of government abuses can be seen as an institutional public good. Institutions prevent rulers from infringing on the rights of their citizens by organizing a "coordinated understanding" of the violation of those rights and allowing citizens to more easily coordinate and respond to potential abuses. That is, when citizens face government abuse, they face a coordination dilemma—they must convince other citizens to band with them to seek redress against the government, which is often difficult. Institutions solve this coordination dilemma in two ways: (1) institutions such as constitutions, legal structures, and civil society provide mechanisms that allow citizens to initially seek redress (e.g. an aggrieved citizen has a constitutional right to sue the government; nonprofit organizations are legally allowed to provide community services the government may be unable to deliver, etc.), and (2) those institutions generate a coordinated understanding—or the expectation that something must and shall be done to address government abuses—among a nation's citizens [@Weingast:1997, 262]. Non-aggrieved citizens assist those who are victims of government abuse because (1) there are institutions in place that allow for redress, and (2) the citizens who are not victims expect that the current victims will come to their aid in the future. Because of this ability to rally popular support for collective action, civil society can be seen as a critical watchdog against government and private sector abuses and thereby protect citizens against the state.

## Authoritarian regimes and institutional balancing

It is clear that civil society can be seen both skeptically (that it serves only to build the state) or optimistically (that it serves only to protect against the state). However, it is perhaps more useful to treat civil society as simply an institutional vehicle for coordinating collective action. As an institution, civil society can exert influence on a regime, pressuring and shaming it to follow specific norms. Conversely, it can also be directed, co-opted, or controlled by the state to help ensure a regime's survival.

A growing literature on the nuances of autocracy has begun to show that authoritarianism is not simply a transitional phase before democracy, but an altogether distinct regime type where autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010]. This newer theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that authoritarians are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism becomes a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can create narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage. Regimes can also create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to create popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this devolution of control to third parties—many of which can be actively opposed to the regime—creates an interesting competitive dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

Ultimately, civil society institutions play a dynamic role in authoritarian regimes and are not simply window dressing. As with other political institutions, civil society aggregates social preferences and creates a focal point, or coordinated understanding, that allows citizens to engage with the state in a coordinated manner. However, it is important to not overstate civil society's potential to challenge the state, as authoritarian leaders can influence the sector to ensure regime stability. The relationship between the state and civil society is bidirectional—domestic and international NGOs can act as anti-government watchdogs or as enablers of the regime, depending on how strategic the state is in capturing or co-opting or how effective NGOs are at avoiding that influence.

# A theory of authoritarian-civil society relations


# Data and methods

However, on their own, these measures can be difficult to interpret. 

These measures of the regulatory environment for civil society, internal regime stability, neighboring regime stability, and international shaming are arguably quite robust (and innovative?). However, (because of math), on their own, they can be difficult to interpret. Table X shows the values for various country years to give a sense of what these measures represent. Between 2000 and 2000, X country (Syria?) saw a x point drop in internal stability; a change in x points in civil society regulations; etc. (example for each + table with a few other examples).
