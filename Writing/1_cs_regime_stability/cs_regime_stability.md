LDS Charities—the official humanitarian wing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)—has long struggled to obtain permission to legally provide its humanitarian services in countries ruled by dictators. The organization offers a variety of services, including neonatal resuscitation training, wheelchair delivery, eye exams, disaster relief, and direct assistance to local orphanages, leprosariums, and medical centers, but its legal status is often ambiguous. Beginning in the early 1990s, the LDS Church worked with Egypt's now-former president Hosni Mubarak to allow LDS Charities to formally register as a foreign charity. Year after year, Mubarak would signal his approval, with the caveat that his Coptic Christian council would ultimately have the final say. However, this council regularly denied all requests for legalization until finally conceding in 2007. Why did Mubarak, an ostensibly omnipotent dictator, defer to his Christian advisors? He had the legal right to approve the request on his own, and given that Egypt was not a democracy, there was arguably little need to show deference for such a small decision.

Conversely, the Open Society Foundations (OSF)—a philanthropic organization backed by American billionaire George Soros—has promoted democratization throughout the world since at least the early 1990s, and has paid particular attention to pro-democracy advocacy and activism in the former Soviet states of Eastern Europe. OSF funds an array of initiatives and programs intended to improve education, strengthen independent media, bolster respect for human rights, and otherwise build democratic values in less democratic nations. However, more authoritarian states such as Russia have long criticized OSF for meddling in domestic affairs, controlling grassroots NGOs, and imposing foreign values in their countries. Despite this criticism, OSF has generally been able to continue supporting its programs and regularly funds and supports local NGOs working on these core issues. Surprisingly, in December 2015, OSF ceased all operations in Russia after being labeled an "undesirable organization"—a legal designation created by a 2015 law that allowed the government to blacklist and expel any organization it deemed too dangerous. President Vladimir Putin had finally found a way to remove OSF from the country. But why had it taken so long?

LDS Charities and the Open Society Foundations are radically different organizations, but they share a common experience of facing a dynamic and unpredictable regulatory environment in the countries they work in. It is likely that Mubarak used LDS Charities and other humanitarian INGOs as pawns in domestic politics. Coptic Christians account for 10–15% of Egypt's population and are both politically active and fearful of persecution. By giving Coptic leaders some say in trivial decisions, Mubarak could, in a way, placate them and help maintain the stability of his regime. Copts, in turn, appeared threatened by foreign Christian groups that could change the balance of Eastern Christian dominance in the country, and thus did not want more Western Christian organizations to work in the country. Though the foreign organizations requesting access dealt with innocuous issues that posed little threat to his regime, Mubarak benefitted from imposing restrictive regulations on certain types of INGOs. Conversely, OSF and other foreign-backed NGOs played an outsized role in Russian domestic politics, as Russian leaders feared creeping Western influence. By restricting these organizations' operations and kicking them out of the country, Putin likely hoped to stabilize his regime and protect it from external threats. 

These two organizations' experience in working under harsh and capricious regulations reflects a broader trend. Over the past decade, international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes as they respond to emergencies, assist with development, or advocate for human rights. However, these services and advocacy can challenge the regime—INGOs that provide essential services such as public health or education can undercut the regime's role as a provider of public goods, and INGOs that advocate for human rights can challenge and embarrass regimes that regularly violate those rights. Despite these risks, the overwhelming majority of authoritarian countries continue to permit INGO activities. How do these regimes limit their exposure to the risks of INGOs? What determines when an autocrat will restrict civil society in their country?

This paper investigates these questions, ultimately seeking to identify the determinants of international civil society regulations in authoritarian regimes. After briefly reviewing the existing literature on authoritarian institutional balancing, and arguing that civil society (and international NGOs in particular) can be treated as a political institution, I lay out a theory to explain how authoritarian regimes determine and adjust the regulatory environment for civil society organizations. I then use a series of statistical models to test my theory's hypotheses. Due to the nature of the data I use, the statistical analysis hints at the determinants of general civil society restrictions and does not distinguish between the regulatory environment for domestic and international NGOs. To better understand the determinants of *international* civil society regulations, I conclude by tracing the history and development of key INGO-related legislation in Russia, testing the implications of my hypotheses throughout the case study. 


# The institutional dynamics of international NGOs in authoritarian regimes

Today, nearly 30 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, early optimism for a global "third wave" of democratization—the rapid transition of the world's last remaining autocracies to liberal democracy—appears quite quixotic. Although most authoritarian regimes hold democratic elections [@LevitskyWay:2010], allow for multiparty legislatures [@Blaydes:2011],  empower an independent judiciary [@GinsburgMoustafa:2008], or use independent central banks to set monetary policy [@Boylan:2001], authoritarianism remains durable. Instead of democratizing, dictatorships don "democratic garb" [@Brownlee:2007, 25] and delegate authority to other domestic institutions in part to maintain their own power, offsetting domestic pressure and boosting their international reputation [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. 

Little research, however, has attempted to explain authoritarian treatment of domestic and transnational civil society through a similar institutional lens. By viewing civil society as yet another institutional actor that autocrats have to balance, we can begin to answer the key question in this chapter: what determines how autocrats regulate civil society in their borders?

## Authoritarian institutional balancing

Dictators are rarely omnipotent or invulnerable. Autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010], a phenomenon I term *institutional balancing* (see [@fig:balancing]). `¶ on institutionalism in comparative politics…`

This theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that authoritarians are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism is best viewed as a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other pseudo democratic institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

![Example of an authoritarian regime balancing multiple domestic and international institutional actors](../../Graphics/balancing.pdf){#fig:balancing}

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can establish narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage, or create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to create popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this dissonance creates an interesting (and potentially destabilizing) dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014]. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

## INGOs: yet another actor to be balanced

Authoritarian institutional balancing is not limited solely to domestic institutions. States today confront a complex stew of domestic and international issues and actors, where activists, bureaucrats, legislators, judges, firms, civil society organizations, international organizations, media organizations, and foreign states interact and influence domestic policy and behavior [@Linos:2013; @Slaughter:2004]. INGOs can provide particularly acute pressure against authoritarian regimes, especially as they work in concert with domestic NGOs to pressure and shame states that behave poorly. Domestic NGOs that are restricted or blocked by their government will turn to allies in the international NGO community, who will in turn lobby their home states to convince international organizations like the UN to put high-level pressure on the offending regime, thereby creating an opening for the original domestic civil society organizations to advocate for policy changes. This relocation of advocacy power follows a boomerang pattern, moving from domestic NGOs to INGOs to foreign states and international organizations to domestic NGOs again [@Keck:1998]. 

With repeated boomerang-like pressure from domestic NGOs and INGOs, responses to individual issues can evolve into human rights norms, resulting in the institutionalization of new policies and practices within an offending state. @RisseSikkink:1999 describe this process of norm socialization as a spiral, or a sequence of repeated boomerang effects. Domestic actors repeatedly turn to INGOs and transnational networks for help in their advocacy and slowly wear down the state. Initially the state denies the accusations of repression and claims that foreign human rights norms are invalid, but with repeated domestic and international pressure, the regime will begin to make concessions to the human rights network. Continued pressure helps formalize these concessions into actual legislation, and as politicians adhere to these policies (again because of domestic and international boomerang effects), they internalize the human rights norms that underpin the policies, thus resulting in long-lasting reform.

Relying on non-state actors as part of domestic institutional balancing is fraught with risk—INGOs are wildcards in authoritarian regimes [@DeMars:2005]. INGOs have real effects on domestic politics and policies and pose significant risks to the regimes that allow them to operate. Close networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012].

![Percent of dictatorships that allow domestic and international institutions](../../Output/figures/1-ingos-dictatorships){#fig:ingos-dictatorships}

In spite of the risks of dealing with INGOs, authoritarians are increasingly opening up their countries to INGO advocacy and services. @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a show that in general, institutionalization in authoritarian regimes has increased over the past century, as dictatorships permit pseudo-democratic electoral institutions, such as party politics and competitive elections. In [@fig:ingos-dictatorships] I add a fourth measure of institutionalization: the percentage of dictatorships that have citizens who are members of more than 50 different INGOs, shown in orange.^[Data collected from the Yearbook of International Organizations and provided in @Murdie:2013. Unfortunately data is only available from 1990–2010. I plan to expand this dataset in the future.] As seen in the figure, international associational life has also grown more active in more of the world's authoritarian regimes since 1990.


# When do dictators restrict civil society?

As with other institutions, autocrats engage with international organizations and transnational civil society selectively, depending on rational calculations of how that engagement might be beneficial to the regime. Authoritarian regimes in particular tend to follow international norms and allow INGO operations only when doing so "allows the regime to [(1)] shore up its authority and legitimacy and to [(2)] deflect international pressures" [@Hawkins:1997, 407–8]. Through regulations and legislation, autocrats can use INGOs and other non-state actors to stabilize and reinforce their political power at home. 

Key to harnessing this institutional dissonance for stability, however, is the autocrat's ability to manage and control these external actors. When dealing with *domestic* challengers and institutions, dictators have a wide array of policy choices to manipulate and control their influence, ranging from formal legislation against certain activities to imprisoning and torturing recalcitrant legislators, judges, or activists. Autocrats have a more limited menu of policy options for controlling *international* actors, however, because of issues of jurisdiction, diplomacy, and global politics. While it maybe be easy to harass and imprison the family of a native activist, attempting to jail or torture international advocates or aid workers is far riskier, as foreigners often have the legal and political backing of their home states. Though there are a handful of instances of authoritarian regimes attempting to formally prosecute foreigners (e.g. in 2013 an Egyptian court convicted 16 American NGO workers, and the government continues to detain reporters and cameramen from the Al Jazeera news network), dictators have a more limited menu of policy levers for controlling INGOs. Most visible is a regime's formal system of laws and regulations regarding INGO advocacy and service provision.

![Theory of the determinants of a regime's civil society regulatory environment](../../Graphics/1-theory-simple){#fig:theory}

I argue that the restrictiveness of a regime's civil society regulatory environment (or CSRE) is a function of three overriding factors (see [@fig:theory]), each connected to the challenge of authoritarian institutional balancing and each a potential threat to regime stability. 

First, tensions and conflict *within* a regime pose serious threats to regime stability, and, as discussed previously, regimes can collapse under the threat of competitive elections, intensification of ethnic conflicts, or revolutions and uprisings [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. Governments facing these pressures will 

{connect all this to institutional balancing - general instability means they have to consolidate against the threats, constrict any openings; internal government stability means the same thing - government threatened from the inside, so need to clamp down on CSRE in the next year

ALSO mention that the CSRE encompasses both domestic and international NGOs


It therefore follows that in times of domestic instability, authoritarian regimes will be more wary of institutional actors like civil society (both domestic and international), and will attempt to minimize institutional dissonance, leading to the following hypotheses:

> **H~1a~**: As a country's internal political instability increases, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

> **H~1b~**: As the internal cohesion of a regime deteriorates, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

Threats to regime stability are not limited to domestic, internal events. Economic, political, military, ethnic, and humanitarian crises can spill over to neighboring states and can have a strong negative effect on a country's political stability and economic performance [@AdesChua:1997]. Beyond general political and military risk in neighboring countries, actual destabilizing events—in particular coups d'etat and popular protests—throughout a region likely influence a regime's decision making and survival strategy. Protests leading to regime change have a propensity to diffuse through a region—for instance, successful anti-regime protests in Egypt and Tunisia in 2011 triggered protests and unrest in neighboring countries [@BamertGilardiWasserfallen:2015]. In particular, coups—either resulting from protests or military intervention—represent the worst-case scenario for autocrats working to maintain stability, as they *force* an irregular exit from power. According to data from @GoemansGleditschChiozza:2009, in the 97 countries I identify as autocracies, 790 executives have left office since 1950. In 240 cases, or nearly one third of all exits, the exit from office occurred irregularly (i.e. not due to term limits or natural death). A clear majority of these irregular collapses of executive power—182, or 75%—occurred as a result of military, political, or rebel coups. Coups are thus a notable threat for autocrats hoping to remain in power, and seeing coup activity in neighboring countries likely alters a regime's stability-maintaining calculus.

The second most common reason for unplanned autocratic exit is forced removal due to popular protest, seen in 21 cases—nearly 10%—of all irregular exits. While protests do not always lead to abdications of power, they can *threaten* to do so. Protests in neighboring countries are also a salient threat to stability, since, as seen during the string of revolutions and uprisings in the Middle East beginning in 2011, popular protests have a tendency to spread [@Kuran:1995; @Kuran:1989; @BamertGilardiWasserfallen:2015; @PatelBunceWolchik:2014]. Thus, regimes wary of the destabilizing influence of events outside their borders will attempt to insulate and protect themselves and change how they regulate domestic actors, leading to the following hypotheses:

> **H~2a~**:  As political instability increases in neighboring countries, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

> **H~2b~**:  As coup activity in neighboring countries increases, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

> **H~2c~**:  As popular protests in neighboring countries increase, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

Finally, governments do not operate in a vacuum, and the domestic policy choices of a regime can be influenced by the preferences of foreign nations [@Linos:2013]. New research shows that states are quite concerned with their international reputations, and condemnation, shaming, and public pressure from abroad can induce changes in domestic policies [@Keck:1998; @Burgerman:2001]. Public reports and rankings issued by INGOs and governments often have a direct effect on policies: countries are more likely to criminalize human trafficking in response to the US State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons report [@KelleySimmons:2015; @Kelley:2016], more likely to conduct fair elections when monitored by foreign organizations [@Kelley:2012], less likely to receive foreign direct investment when condemned by INGOs [@BarryClayFlynn:2013], and more likely respect human rights when cajoled and censured by INGOs [@Murdie:2012; @Murdie:2014a]. 

Anecdotal evidence shows that regimes also care about how their civil society regulations are perceived internationally. For example, as Kazakhstan mulled over a more restrictive NGO law in 2005, American diplomats met with Kazakhstani officials and used the spectre of international reputation to argue that "the best way for Kazakhstan to distinguish itself from its neighbors" was to respect international and domestic institutions, conduct fair presidential elections in 2006, and not pass the NGO law.[^1] Kazakhstan caved to the pressure and did not pass the law. In fact, promoting and maintaining their international reputation continued to be a strong driver of Kazakh policy thereafter. Throughout the mid-2000s, Kazakhstan worked to attain chairmanship over the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), with the explicit hope of showing off its "high international reputation," and the country received the position in 2007.[^2] This leads to my final hypothesis: 

> **H~3~**:  As international shaming and condemnation of a regime increases, the *less* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

# Data and methods

To these hypotheses, I construct a new time-series, cross-sectional dataset of 97 autocracies from 1991–2014, compiling a set of variables from several well-established and new data sources.

In spite of the methodological advances of the CSRE index and the comprehensive collections of NGO legislation, no measure fully reflects the regulatory environment for *international* NGOs. There is unfortunately no systematic way to quantitatively disentangle the application of the regulatory environment to domestic and international organizations—laws that govern civil society tend to cover both domestic and international organization, and regulations that are applied to international NGOs are often the same as those applied to domestic NGOs. With a few notable exceptions, regimes rarely craft legislation aimed primarily and exclusively at regulating *international* NGOs. 

Thus, the analysis of the civil society regulatory environment in this chapter encompasses domestic, foreign-funded domestic, and foreign NGOs. In the following chapter I carefully examine each of my theory's hypotheses in the cases of Russia, China, and Egypt, look at each regime's imposition of legislation targeted specifically at international NGOs, and compare the conclusions of the case studies with the statistical results of this chapter.

## Dependent variable

### Measuring civil society restrictions

Empirically measuring the severity and extent of civil society legal restrictions is difficult. Scholars have used a handful of measures, including the CIVICUS Civil Society Index (CSI),[^3] the Global Civil Society Index (GCSI),[^4] global and regional public opinion surveys, and the CIRI Human Rights Data Project,[^5] but each of these variables faces substantial issues with scope, validity, and consistency. 

The CSI evaluates domestic civil society structure and values using country experts' opinions regarding four dimensions,[^6] scores each dimension on a 1–3 scale, and provides a final summative index—countries with a higher score ostensibly have a stronger civil society sector. However, CSI data has been collected in a few 2–3 year waves in only 30–50 countries, and has not been updated since 2012, making it difficult to use in annual cross-sectional analysis. In 2004, the Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies created the GCSI as a rival index. Similar to the CSI, the GCSI rates civil society along three dimensions[^7] and provides a final summative index to represent the strength of a country's civil society. However, the GCSI has not been updated since 2004, and it only includes a handful of non-OECD countries, which makes it unsuitable for studying civil society in authoritarian regimes. 

Scholars have also used public opinion surveys such as the World Values Survey (WVS)[^8] or regional projects like the Arab Barometer,[^9] Afrobarometer,[^10] and Asian Barometer[^11] to measure and analyze individual perceptions of associational life and participation in domestic and international NGOs [@Jamal:2007; @Bernhard:2007]. However, these surveys are not conducted annually (the WVS is done every 5 years; regional barometers are done every 3–5 years) and like the CSI and GCSI, are not suitable for large-*N*, country-level analysis. 

Finally, the CIRI Human Rights project provides indices of human rights restrictions based on close readings of annual US State Department *Country Reports on Human Rights Practices* [@CingranelliRichardsClay:2014]. Among the rights measured by CIRI is a measure of the restrictions on the freedom of assembly and association, or how easily citizens can participate in trade unions, cultural organizations, or domestic and international NGOs. Countries can receive one of three scores each year—severely restricted, limited, and unrestricted—based on the severity and universality of civil society restrictions within each country. CIRI data is available for nearly 200 countries annually since 1981, making it ideal for cross-sectional analysis. However, with only three possible outcomes the data is sluggish and not granular, and it fails to pick up on slight changes in the regulatory environment.

### The Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE) Index

These difficulties with data quality are not limited to civil society measures—many democracy-related indicators, including elections, judicial independence, and legislative activity, have spotty and inconsistent coverage over time and are not always reliable. A new project—the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)—however, attempts to address these issues. V-Dem uses a sophisticated Bayesian measurement model to aggregate existing published data and opinions from more than 2,500 country experts to provide hundreds of robust democracy-related indicators and indexes. Most importantly, in contrast with the CSI, GCSI, public opinion surveys, and CIRI, V-Dem indicators are available for most countries from 1900–2014 and display variation over time. 

V-Dem includes many variables related to the regulatory legal environment for civil society, including measures of entry and exit regulations, repression, participatory environment, and the level of women's participation in associational life. Scholars associated with V-Dem used these indicators to generate a Core Civil Society Index (CCSI), which measures the strength of civil society in a country given (1) the organizational environment for civil society organizations and (2) the level of citizen activism [@BernhardTzelgovJung:2015]. 

Following this lead, I construct my own Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE) index to measure only state constraints on civil society, ignoring citizen participation in associational life, based on the CCSI's indicators for civil society organizational environment: (1) the level of state repression of civil society organizations and (2) the level of state control over civil society organization entry and exit into public life. The CCSI was constructed by aggregating several V-Dem variables using Bayesian factor analysis; for the sake of simplicity, my CSRE index uses only a sum of the relevant V-Dem indicators.

While V-Dem's unique combination of Bayesian modeling and detailed expert opinion makes the CSRE index arguably more robust and reliable than any single measure, it also means that the index is more difficult to interpret, as it is essentially a sum of scale-less vectors of model point estimates. [@fig:csre-top-bottom] provides some helpful context for understanding this index, showing the average environment index for the five highest and lowest countries from 2000–2014. The index ranges between roughly −6 and 6, with more repressive countries receiving lower scores—the average index score for autocracies is 0.3, while democracies average 3.7.

![Mean CSRE for five highest and lowest countries from 2000–2014](../../Output/figures/1-csre-top-bottom.pdf){#fig:csre-top-bottom}

To test the validity of the CSRE, I compare with it data that tracks the *de jure* regulations on NGOs in dozens of countries. Newer research on NGO regulations has taken a different approach to measuring restrictions on civil society—instead of using country reports, public opinion surveys, or expert opinion to measure the general environment for civil society, scholars have begun to hand-code all legislation aimed at regulating or restricting specific aspects of NGO operations throughout the world. @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a and @ChristensenWeinstein:2013 have each collected remarkable data on regulations aimed at restricting *domestic* NGOs from registering, receiving foreign funding, or engaging in advocacy, noting the specific bills, decrees, and constitutional laws that prohibit these activities. These databases of legal restrictions are not as comprehensive as the data available from V-Dem: Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash include foreign funding restrictions in 45 countries from 1993–2012, while Christensen and Weinstein include funding, registration, and advocacy regulations in 98 countries from 1909–2012.

![Relationship between types of NGO legal barriers and the CSRE](../../Output/figures/1-csre-dcjw.pdf){#fig:csre-dcjw}

Because the data collected by Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash only includes one measure of civil society restriction for a smaller subset of countries, the relationship between their data and the CSRE is non-existent. However, as seen in [@fig:csre-dcjw], Christensen and Weinstein's count of legal barriers for NGOs is negatively correlated with the CSRE and fits with the logic of the index. In most years, most countries tend to only have a minimal number of formal laws limiting civil society activity and, as shown by the superimposed locally weighted average curves, moving from no barriers to one barrier only decreases the CSRE marginally, since it is likely normal for governments to assert some sort of legal control over NGOs. But as the number of formal barriers increases beyond a minimal regulatory regime, the CSRE steadily worsens. The form of legal restriction appears to have differential effects on the overall regulatory environment. [@tbl:csre-dcjw-coefs] lists the coefficients from a simple linear model predicting the CSRE based on the number of legal barriers. The addition of any anti-NGO law predictably worsens the overall legal environment, but imposing barriers to advocacy appears to have a larger effect than advocacy or entry, most likely because such laws target a subset of NGOs that pose more of a potential threat to regime stability.

## Explanatory variables

### Identifying autocracies

I use two different methods to identify autocracies. First, I use the Unified Democracy Score (UDS) scale to capture country-level democratization. Scholars have long used data from the Polity IV project [@MarshallJaggers:2014], which assigns democracy scores ranging from −10 to 10 and categorizes countries into one of three regime types based on those scores: autocracies (−10 to −6), anocracies (−5 to 5), and democracies (6 to 10). Though these categories of democratization are useful at large magnitudes (i.e. there is a clear difference between a country that scores a −8 on the Polity IV scale and one that scores a 6), marginal changes in democratization scores are often meaningless (i.e. a change from a level 5 anocracy to a level 6 democracy is rather imperceptible and more susceptible to rater subjectivity). The UDS scale was created in 2010 to address the uncertainty inherent in measuring democratization [@PemsteinMeserveMelton:2010]. This scale uses Bayesian estimation and simulation to generate aggregate democracy scores based on 10 other standard measurement scales (including Polity IV). Instead of assigning each country a single score, the UDS provides every country-year with a posterior score distribution ranging from −2 to 2, with more democratic nations receiving higher scores. For the sake of analytic simplicity, I use a cutoff point of zero to roughly classify countries as democracies and autocracies, resulting in 86 authoritarian regimes.

Classifying regime type with an arbitrary numeric threshold is convenient, but can lead to substantial analytic issues. In their research on autocratic breakdown, @GeddesWrightFrantz:2014 found that in previous studies on autocratic breakdowns, using Polity thresholds as a proxy for autocracy overestimated predictions of regime survival by 100 percent, indicating that Polity's parsimony and simplicity fails to capture the nuances of autocratic rule. Accordingly, I also identify autocracies using data from @GeddesWrightFrantz:2014, who categorize 154 countries as various varieties of autocracies, including oligarchies, monarchies, and various combinations of personal, party, and military rule. 

These two approaches to identifying regime type yield slightly different categorizations—there are 89 countries with UDS scores below zero and 86 countries labeled as autocracies by Geddes, et al. To address this discrepancy and find the widest possible definition of autocracy, I include all countries that appear in either dataset, resulting in 97 states.[^12] For the sake of completeness, I consider a country to be autocratic it it has ever been categorized as such since 1991, meaning that countries that democratize or backslide are included. 

### Internal regime stability and conflict

I hypothesize that political stability and internal regime conflict predict restrictions on civil society. I measure two sources of regime stability: internal political stability and government stability. First, I use data from Political Risk Services' International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) to measure the internal risk and stability of a regime [@Political-Risk-Services:2014]. ICRG provides a monthly political risk rating for 143 countries based on a weighted collection of indicators, including government stability, corruption, ethnic tensions, and conflict.[^13] Risk ratings range from 0–100, with the most stable countries receiving the highest scores, and the most unstable countries ranking around 30–40. As I am interested in *internal* regime stability, I omit the subcomponent of the score measuring external conflict, and to avoid issues with collinearity, I omit the subcomponent measuring democratic accountability, since I use other indicators of democracy, explained below. Having removed these subcomponents, I rescale the risk score to have a maximum of 100 to generate a final internal political risk index.[^14] Finally in the interest of clarity, because the term "risk" carries negative connotations and the ICRG risk index increases as stability improves (i.e. as a country's risk score improves, political conditions improve), I redefine internal political *risk* as internal *political stability* . Second, I use the ICRG subindicator for government stability on its own, as it captures instability within the ruling regime itself.

![Changes in ICRG internal political stability index over time](../../Output/figures/1-icrg-examples.pdf){#fig:icrg-examples}

To demonstrate how shifts in internal political stability and government stability are actually represented, [@fig:icrg-examples] shows the these values for three authoritarian states: Qatar and Somalia, which have the maximum and minimum values of stability, respectively, and Syria, which has seen the most volatility. In the 10 years prior to the Syrian war, the country dropped 10 points in its internal stability score, representative of a slow deterioration and stagnation of internal stability. Syria's government stability during this time remained relatively high and constant, however. From 2010–2014, the country dropped nearly 20 points in internal political stability, and its government stability dropped to roughly the same as Somalia. Few countries have seen such dramatic and precipitous drops in stability scores—in general, across all autocratic states between 2000–2014, the average difference between minimum and maximum internal stability scores was 10.6 and the average difference in internal stability scores was 3.7. 

Beyond aggregate regime stability, I include several variables directly related to domestic political institutions. I measure how many consecutive years the executive has been in office with data from the World Bank's Database of Political Institutions [@BeckClarkeGroff:2001], which indicates the longevity of the regime. I also include measures of regime competitiveness. Using data from the National Elections Across Democracy and Autocracy (NELDA) project [@HydeMarinov:2012], I calculate the number of years that have passed since a country held a competitive election. Following @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a, I consider an election competitive if opposition parties were allowed to participate, if more than one political party was legal, and if the ballot provided voters with a choice of candidates. I also count the vote share won by the largest opposition party, as measured by the Database of Political Institutions [@BeckClarkeGroff:2001].

### Stability of neighboring countries

I also hypothesize that external stability affects civil society restrictions within states. That is, when a regime observes general instability, coups, and popular protests in nearby countries, it will crack down on associational life and increase restrictions on civil society in an effort to minimize domestic institutional dissonance. I measure a country's exposure to external risk and conflict using the 0–100 internal ICRG political stability score (described above) of all other countries weighted by distance.[^15] Weighting risk by distance permits me to assume that the level of internal stability in countries closest to a given state has the greatest bearing on that regime's behavior, while also allowing for more distant unrest to influence a regime's decisions. 

To supplement the more general measure of ICRG stability, I include data on the number of coups and popular protests in neighboring countries. I measure the level of coup activity by counting all successful and unsuccessful coups in a state's neighbors in each year [@PowellThyne:2011]. I define a country's neighbors to include all states at within 900 km of the closest border, rather than including only states that share a contiguous border [@Gleditsch:2002]. I do not use the overall weighted average of coups, assuming that coup activity in distant states has little effect on a given regime (i.e. coups in Sierra Leone are not likely to worry executives in Tajikistan).

In contrast to the readily available (and more easily countable) data on coup activity, measuring protests is more difficult. In an attempt to quantify global protest activity, I use I use event data methods to construct new measures of violent and nonviolent protests in a given state. Event data uses computational natural language text algorithms to parse a text and determine *who* did *what* to *whom* *where* and *when*. After feeding millions of news media stories into this algorithm, the resulting data identifies the main actors, actions, and locations in a story, and can be used to track any number of events of interest. I use event data from DARPA's Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS),[^16] which tracks more than 14 million events from 1995 to 2016 and includes nearly 180,000 instances of both nonviolent and violent protest across the 97 autocracies I have selected.[^17] 

However, using these events in a statistical model is not a straightforward task. Because media reports form the foundation of ICEWS, event data is by nature biased by the quantity of media coverage. Using a raw count of events in each country is not possible, since larger, more covered countries will inherently see more events. Conversely, dividing the count of events of interest by the total number of events in a country to create a percent-based index results in a measure that is biased towards less-covered countries. For example, ICEWS records only two events in Barbados in 2015, one of which was a nonviolent protest, meaning that a simple ratio would show that half of all events that year were protests. 

Instead of using counts or ratios, I generate a standardized measure by centering and rescaling the count of events of interest in each country over time, resulting in a variable that ranges roughly between 1 and 5—a value around 1 indicates that a country experienced fewer events of interest in a year than what they typically see, while a 5 indicates that it experienced far more than normal.[^18] [@fig:protests-egypt-china] provides an example of this rescaled measure, showing absolute and relative protest activity in both China and Egypt. China's low and steady hum of nonviolent protests remains roughly constant over the time period, with a spike in 2008 due to both the Tibetan uprising and the Olympic games. Violent protests peaked in 2012 due to ongoing tensions in Tibet and nationwide anti-Japanese protests. The standardization process scales both of these peaks to roughly five. A similar pattern occurs in Egypt, with a small uptick in protest activity in 2005 due to the country's first competitive presidential election, and a significant spike during the Arab Spring in 2011–2013. Though the counts of events are not comparable between the two countries, the standardized measure can be used across countries, showing here that the rapid increases in protests were indeed unexpected. 

![Protest events in Egypt and China—raw counts and standardized index](../../Output/figures/1-protests-egypt-china.pdf){#fig:protests-egypt-china}

As with the general ICRG-based measure of neighbor instability, I calculated the distance-weighted average for protests, since the reverberations of protests can be felt further off. Whereas a regime observing a faraway *coup* will not likely worry as much about contagion, the costs of participating in *popular protests* are generally lower than outright revolution and media coverage of foreign protests is more readily available, thus increasing the likelihood that dissidents will protest against the government.

### International shaming

Finally, I argue that reputational concerns influence an autocrat's decision to regulate civil society. As discussed previously, a growing body of research has shown that countries adjust their behavior in response to international shaming. In these studies, shaming has typically been tied to specific reports, scores, and rankings issued by states, IGOs, and NGOs regarding specific policy issues. For instance, the US State Department's annual TIP report shames states into taking action on human trafficking issues, the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index motivates states to improving the environment for business and investment, and Transparency International calls out states on their handling of government corruption. Unfortunately, however, no country, IGO, or NGO publishes any index related to civil society repression. 

Since I cannot measure international shaming related to regimes' treatment of civil society specifically, I generate a more general measure that captures the overall level of international condemnation faced by a country. Previous research on media and politics has identified a "CNN effect" where increased international coverage of humanitarian disasters can encourage states to intervene [@Robinson:2011]. @MurdiePeksen:2014 find a similar effect for INGOs and use event data to show that more conflictual events between INGOs and states raises the likelihood for armed foreign humanitarian interventions. Under the assumption that heightened media coverage of international condemnation represents a more general form of shaming, I identify roughly 80,000 events in ICEWS where a state source condemns a state target in the 97 countries identified as autocracies.[^19]As with the measures of protest activity in neighboring countries, I center and rescale the count of shaming events in each country, where 1 indicates less shaming than normal and 5 indicates substantially more.

## Modeling decisions

Instead of testing my hypotheses with frequentist null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), the standard statistical approach in much of the existing research on international relations and comparative politics, I estimate a series of Bayesian generalized linear models. I use Bayesian methods primarily because they yield more meaningful inferences [@Kruschke:2010; @Korner-NievergeltRothFelten:2015; @GelmanCarlinStern:2013]. Frequentist NHST analysis determines the *probability of the data* given a *null hypothesis* (i.e. $P(\text{data} | H_0)$), yielding results that are often unwieldy, phrased as the probability of rejecting the null if it is true. In contrast, Bayesian analysis determines the *probability of a hypothesis* given *the data* (i.e. $P(H | \text{data})$), resulting in probabilities that are directly interpretable, phrased simply as the probability that the hypothesis is true. Similarly, Bayesian analysis provides more interpretable measures of uncertainty. Given frequentist-estimated parameters, we can calculate a 95% confidence interval that indicates that if the data were generated several more times, 95% of the resulting confidence intervals would contain the true parameter.[^20]With Bayesian methods, uncertainty can be described with a credible interval, which simply indicates that we can be 95% sure that the true parameter is with that interval. Bayesian analysis is not a silver bullet for inference—the linear models I fit must still be well specified and fit standard statistical assumptions (i.e. homoskedasticity of errors, absence multicollinearity, etc.). However, the framework usefully provides a more interpretable set of results.

I use weakly informative prior distributions for each of the coefficient parameters, based on a Cauchy distribution with a location of 0 and a scale of 1. I obtain the posterior distribution of the CSRE with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and simulate values from the joint posterior distribution of the coefficient parameters.[^21] I use the medians of the simulated values from the MCMC samples as coefficient estimates, and use the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles as lower and upper limits for 95% credible intervals. Finally, I declare an effect statistically significant if the posterior probability of being different from zero is larger than 0.99.

As discussed previously, I employ large-*n* analysis (LNA), which entails parsimonious model specification with minimal controls. I lead the CSRE by one year in each model to capture the lagged effect of all dependent variables, and I include year fixed effects as the only control variable. While this is admittedly a rough and naive identification strategy, these models are ultimately meant to demonstrate the conjoint determinants of the civil society regulatory environment in general, and not a precisely estimated treatment effect. Again, these results inform and complement the small-*n* analysis (SNA) of the following chapters, where I explore each causal mechanism in more depth.

# Results and discussion

[@fig:coefs-bayes] presents the estimates two variations of model specifications. In the basic, most parsimonious model, I measure the effect of internal determinants using only political risk and government risk measures, external determinants using only coups and protest activity in neighboring countries, and reputational determinants using the relative measure of international shaming. In the alternate model, I include additional measures of regime stability and longevity as internal determinants and a more general distance-weighted measure of neighbor instability. The full results of both models are included in [@tbl:results-basic] and [@tbl:results-alternate] in the appendix.

![Determinants of the civil society regulatory environment](../../Output/figures/1-coefs-bayes){#fig:coefs-bayes}

## Internal determinants

I begin by examining my first hypothesis—that autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society more as they face more instability within their countries in general and within their regime specifically. In both model specifications, increased internal political stability is associated with improved scores in the CSRE in the following year. For every unit increase in the rescaled internal stability index, the CSRE increases by approximately 0.05 points, which is a small but potentially potent change, given that the stability index ranges from 0–100 and countries typically see more sizable changes in their stability over time. The left panel of [@fig:int-pred] demonstrates this cumulative effect visually, showing the predicted CSRE across the range of possible political stability scores, with all other model parameters held at their mean values. All else equal, by only varying internal political stability, the CSRE can move from 0 to 3 (or vice versa, as stability decreases). There is therefore strong evidence for H~1a~ (P(β \> 0) = 1)—as regimes control general internal threats to stability, maintain efficient bureaucracies, control corruption, and see fewer instances of ethnic and religious conflict, the environment for civil society improves, and conversely, increasing political instability leads to a more restricted environment.

![(L) Predicted CSRE across range of possible internal political risk scores; (R) predicted CSRE across range of government risk scores and length of executive tenure. All model covariates held at their means.](../../Output/figures/1-int-pred){#fig:int-pred}

The model offers contradictory evidence for H~1b~. I had hypothesized that autocrats would restrict the CSRE as the internal cohesion of the regime deteriorated. However, across both specifications of the model, autocratic government stability is significantly and *negatively* associated with the CSRE in the following year, resulting in a decrease of nearly 0.2 (P(β \< 0) = 1). That is, as a regime consulates its power and internal unity, it does not, in fact, increase the space for institutional dissonance for civil society organizations. Instead, it appears that autocratic entrenchment and stabilization leads to a more restrictive regulatory environment. 

The three additional measures of regime longevity bolster this evidence. Executive tenure is significantly and negatively associated with civil society regulations, and for every year in office, the CSRE will decrease by 0.1 on average (P(β \< 0) = 1). The number of years that elapse between competitive executive elections has a similar effect, decreasing the CSRE by nearly 0.05 each year, *ceteris paribus*. The right panel of [@fig:int-pred] shows the substantial effects of these coefficients, demonstrating the predicted CSRE across a range of possible government stability values for countries with executives in office for 2 and 30 years. Contra my hypothesis, the CSRE clearly decreases both when regime stability increases and as autocrats remain in office longer.

Finally, the share of votes won by the opposition party is associated with an improved CSRE (β = 0.4; P(β \> 0) = 1). This may indicate a degree of endogeneity in the model—autocratic regimes with more electoral competition are more likely to have better, more open civil societies, regardless of executive tenure—but it is still a useful indication of regime behavior towards institutions. In countries where institutionalization is encouraged or allowed (i.e. where opposition parties win elections), other institutions such as civil society benefit, while countries with minimal institutionalization are more likely to have executives with longer tenure and thus worse civil society.

Following my hypothesis, autocrats should restrict civil society more as regime instability increases. These models provide conflicting evidence for this assertion. The internal political stability of a country is clearly positively associated with civil society regulations. States facing internal crises and other direct threats to regime survival are more likely to crack down on domestic and international civil society, while states facing calmer domestic politics are more likely to make concessions to civil society and allow for more institutional dissonance. Internal government stability, on the other hand, plays a countervailing role in the calculus to restrict civil society. Regimes that are more unified, stable, and durable appear to have sufficient political capital to impose restrictions on civil society. 

## External risk

In my second hypothesis I propose that increasing political risks in a state's neighboring countries influence the regime's treatment of civil society. I test the effect of regional instability in two ways, using counts of coups and protest activity in the basic model with  a more generalized measure of neighboring instability in the alternate model. The ICRG political stability of a country's neighbors, weighted by distance, has a clear negative effect on the civil society regulatory environment in the following year, lowering the index by 0.04 points (P(β \< 0) = 1) for every unit increase in average neighboring stability. While this effect is small, it again has a powerful cumulative effect, and countries experiencing wide swings in neighborhood stability are expected to made large corresponding changes in the CSRE. The downward trend in the left panel of [@fig:ext-pred] makes this trend clear as the CSRE index drops. Notably, this finding is contrary to H~2a~, showing that autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society as political stability in neighboring country *improves*, not worsens.

![(L) Predicted CSRE across range of possible distance-weighted overall risk scores, with and without coup activity; (R) predicted CSRE across range of possible levels of violent and nonviolent protest activity. All model covariates held at their means.](../../Output/figures/1-ext-pred){#fig:ext-pred}

The general ICRG-based measure of neighboring regime stability captures a range of possible sources of instability, including corruption, military involvement in politics, ethnic conflict, and civil wars. Under the assumption that different types of instability matter more to autocratic stability-seeking calculus, I hypothesize that coups and protests in neighboring have an effect on the CSRE. In both model specifications, coup activity is associated with an improved regulatory environment—the presence of an attempted or successful coup in a close neighbor increases the CSRE by approximately 0.5 in the following year (P(β \> 0) = 1). The difference between the two lines in the left panel of [@fig:ext-pred] shows this effect, with countries seeing coup activity receiving higher predicted CSRE scores. Again, this finding goes contrary to hypothesized expectations, revealing the opposite of H~2b~—in general, autocrats *expand* the regulatory environment for civil society when there are nearby coups.

Protests in the region have a substantial effect on the CSRE, but in different ways. In both model specifications increased relative violent protest activity in the region is negatively associated with civil society regulations, indicating that autocrats constrict the CSRE as they witness violent protests among their peer nations. More violent protests than normal results in a drop in the CSRE of roughly 0.2 (P(β \< 0) = 0.98 in basic model; P(β \< 0) = 0.85 in alternate model). Conversely, autocrats expand the environment when witnessing nearby nonviolent protests—unusually high levels of nonviolent protest activity the region is associated with an increase in the CSRE of 0.5 (P(β \> 0) = 1), roughly the same magnitude of change seen when there are coups. The right panel of [@fig:ext-pred] demonstrates the divergent effect of distance-weighted violent and nonviolent protest activity. These findings add some complexity to H~2c~, demonstrating that autocrats restrict the civil society regulatory environment in response to *violent* popular protests in neighboring countries, but expand that environment in response to *nonviolent* protests.

Taken together, though these findings contradict my second hypothesis, they reveal nuances in the external determinants of the institutional treatment of civil society as a strategy for maintaining stability. In general, as autocrats witness political instability and violence in their neighbors, they have an incentive to make concessions to civil society and expand the regulatory environment for NGO activity. Coups, nonviolent protests, and general political instability abroad appears to encourage autocrats to permit increased institutional dissonance at home as a hedging mechanism, heading off the threat of contagion by allowing for more robust associational life. Conversely, as with internal regime stability, having more stable and safe neighbors appears to provide autocrats with cover to impose more restrictions on civil society. Finally, autocrats react to violent protests differently, as these likely represent a more immediate threat to contagion. While nonviolent protests can be contained by permitting additional institutional dissonance and allowing civil society to be more active, violent protests have a higher likelihood of leading to regime change and thus result in a more constricted regulatory environment. After coups in neighboring countries—the assumed endgame of violent protests—are a *fait accompli*, it appears that autocrats attempt to mitigate future diffusion by expanding the CSRE. 

## Shaming

Finally, [@fig:coefs-shame] shows the relationship between reputational and shame-based factors and civil society regulations.

![Reputational determinants of the civil society regulatory environment](../../Output/figures/1-coefs-shame.pdf){#fig:coefs-shame}

When not controlling for any other factors, interstate shaming (as measured by the percent of all reported events that are categorized as either materially or verbally conflictual) appears to have a powerful negative relationship with civil society regulations. Higher proportions of conflictual interactions are negatively associated with the CSRE—at first glance, more shaming leads to more restrictions. After other factors are included in the model, though, this interstate shaming effect disappears. Similarly, the severity of interstate shaming is not significantly related to the CSRE.

INGO-based shaming, on the other hand, does appear to have a significant relationship with civil society regulations. Higher proportions of INGO-led conflictual events lead to large and substantial improvements in the CSRE, perhaps indicating that INGOs may sometimes circumvent the boomerang model of activism, targeting recalcitrant regimes directly rather than working through a friendly state. The nature of the conflict appears to matter too—more severe types of INGO-led conflict are negatively associated with the CSRE, possibly demonstrating a need for more reticence in shaming campaigns (see [@fig:shame-severity-pred]).

![Reputational determinants of the civil society regulatory environment](../../Output/figures/1-shame-severity-pred.pdf){#fig:shame-severity-pred}

Given these findings, support for hypothesis 3 is once again mixed. Formal, high-level diplomatic shaming and conflict from other states does not appear to be associated with any changes in the regulatory environment for civil society. Conflict initiated by human rights INGOs against states, however, may have a positive relationship with the CSRE. It thus appears that authoritarian regimes are less responsive to diplomatic pressure and more responsive to INGO activism. It is important to note that much of this effect might be due to the fact that interstate shaming is too broad a variable—INGOs are more likely to clash with states over their treatment of civil society actors, condemning regimes for imprisoning activists or restricting freedom of assembly, while states clash with other states over a much wider range of issues (e.g. monetary policy, trade disputes, diplomatic rows, etc.). 


# Conclusion

Civil society, both domestic and international, acts as an institution within authoritarian regimes, and accordingly, is one of the many institutional challengers that dictators must control and balance to remain in power. In an effort to curb the potential destabilizing risks associated with foreign organizations, autocrats limit civil society through legislation and regulations, and the severity and restrictiveness of this regulatory environment is a function of a regime's internal stability and political risk, the level of risk and conflict in neighboring countries, and international condemnation and shaming of a regime's actions.

The statistical models presented in this paper provide mixed support for each of these factors, indicating that internal, external, and reputational concerns can drive a dictator's decision to repress and limit civil society activity in general. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the data, this analysis does not distinguish between the regulatory environment for domestic and international NGOs. Tracing the development of INGO regulations in Russia, however, bolsters the theory, adds nuance that was not captured by the statistical models, and provides additional evidence for the theory.
