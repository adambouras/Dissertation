LDS Charities—the official humanitarian wing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)—has long struggled to obtain permission to legally provide its humanitarian services in countries ruled by dictators. The organization offers a variety of services, including neonatal resuscitation training, wheelchair delivery, eye exams, disaster relief, and direct assistance to local orphanages, leprosariums, and medical centers, but its legal status is often ambiguous. Beginning in the early 1990s, the LDS Church worked with former Egyptian president Ḥosni Mubarak to allow LDS Charities to formally register as a foreign charity. Year after year, Mubarak would signal his approval, with the caveat that his Coptic Christian council would ultimately have the final say. However, this council regularly denied all requests for legalization until finally conceding in 2007. Why did Mubarak, an ostensibly omnipotent dictator, defer to his Christian advisors? He had the legal right to approve the request on his own, and given that Egypt was not a democracy, there was arguably little need to show deference for such a small decision.

Conversely, the Open Society Foundations (OSF)—a philanthropic organization backed by American billionaire George Soros—has promoted democratization throughout the world since at least the early 1990s, and has paid particular attention to pro-democracy advocacy and activism in the former Soviet states of Eastern Europe. OSF funds an array of initiatives and programs intended to improve education, strengthen independent media, bolster respect for human rights, and otherwise build democratic values in less democratic nations. However, more authoritarian states such as Russia have long criticized OSF for meddling in domestic affairs, controlling grassroots NGOs, and imposing foreign values in their countries. Despite this criticism, OSF has generally been able to continue supporting its programs and regularly funds and supports local NGOs working on these core issues. Surprisingly, in December 2015, OSF ceased all operations in Russia after being labeled an "undesirable organization"—a legal designation created by a 2015 law that allowed the government to blacklist and expel any organization it deemed too dangerous. OSF had been active in Russia for decades—why did the government wait until 2015 to finally end their operations?

Though they have radically different missions, the experiences of LDS Charities and the Open Society Foundations are indicative of a larger trend of closing civic space and worsening restrictions on international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs). Other examples abound—Greenpeace and The Asia Foundation work in China despite stricter rules for foreign NGOs, and Human Rights Watch maintains field offices in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and other Central Asian dictatorships under close government surveillance.[^1] 

Autocrats willingly allow these organizations to operate in their countries, but these regimes set the terms for INGO action. It is likely that Mubarak used LDS Charities and other humanitarian INGOs as pawns in domestic politics. Coptic Christians account for 10–15% of Egypt's population and are both politically active and fearful of persecution. By giving Coptic leaders some say in minor decisions, Mubarak could, in a way, placate them and help maintain the stability of his regime. Copts, in turn, felt threatened by foreign Christian groups that could change the balance of Eastern Christian dominance in the country, and thus did not want more Western Christian organizations to work in the country. Though the foreign organizations requesting access dealt with innocuous issues that posed little threat to his regime, Mubarak benefitted from imposing restrictive regulations on certain types of INGOs. Conversely, OSF and other foreign-backed NGOs played an outsized role in Russian domestic politics as Russian leaders feared creeping Western influence. Throughout 2015, Russia faced a flagging economy, nascent popular political dissent, and continuing military operations in Ukraine. By restricting these foreign organizations' operations and expelling them from the country, Putin helped shore up the stability and unity of his regime during a time of extreme volatility. In both cases, Mubarak and Putin regulated INGOs in pursuit of domestic regime stability.

Over the past decade, INGOs have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes as they respond to emergencies, assist with development, or advocate for human rights. However, these services and advocacy can challenge the regime—INGOs that provide essential services such as public health or education can undercut the regime's role as a provider of public goods, and INGOs that advocate for human rights can challenge and embarrass regimes that regularly violate those rights. Despite these risks, the overwhelming majority of authoritarian countries continue to permit INGO activities. How do these regimes limit their exposure to the risks of INGOs? What determines when an autocrat will restrict civil society in their country?

![Space around regime ideal point: civil society regulatory environment](../../Graphics/theory-regime-space){#fig:theory-regime-space}

In this chapter, I investigate these questions, ultimately seeking to identify the determinants of civil society regulations in authoritarian regimes. I zoom in on the first element of the theory of amicable contempt—the regime's negotiation space around its ideal point (see @fig:theory-regime-space)—and explore how authoritarian regimes determine and adjust the regulatory environment for civil society organizations in response to (1) anxiety over internal social and government stability, (2) fear of contagion from political instability in neighboring countries, and (3) concern about international reputation.


# When do dictators restrict civil society?

As with other institutions, autocrats engage with international organizations and transnational civil society selectively, depending on rational calculations of how that engagement might be beneficial to the regime. Authoritarian regimes in particular tend to follow international norms and allow INGO operations only when doing so allows the government to "shore up its authority and legitimacy" and "deflect international pressures" [@Hawkins:1997, 407–8]. Key to harnessing this institutional dissonance for stability, however, is the autocrat's ability to manage and control these external actors. Through formal regulations and legislation and the de facto implementation of those laws, autocrats can use INGOs and other non-state actors to stabilize and reinforce their political power at home. I argue that the restrictiveness of a regime's civil society regulatory environment (or CSRE) is a function of three general factors (see @fig:theory-regime-effects), each connected to the challenge of authoritarian institutional balancing and each a potential threat to regime stability. 

![Determinants of a regime's civil society regulatory environment](../../Graphics/theory-regime-effects){#fig:theory-regime-effects}

First, tensions and conflict *within* a country pose serious threats to regime stability, given that regimes can collapse under the threat of competitive elections, intensification of ethnic conflicts, or revolutions and uprisings [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. During times of domestic instability and unrest, autocratic regimes face increased threats from various institutional actors. For instance, when facing civil or ethnic conflict, the behavior of the military and opposition parties will be more uncertain, and when facing economic crises, a nation's central bank, labor unions, and general population will be more contentious and unpredictable, making the act of institutional balancing much more precarious. To maintain balance, dictators must consolidate against threats to stability and limit the allowable institutional dissonance. If the regime itself is unstable and incohesive—that is, if fissions and fractures among the ruling elite threaten government stability—the regime should have a similar response, constricting existing institutions and limiting their possible influence. This dynamic leads to the following hypotheses:

> **H~1a~**: As a country's domestic political instability increases, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

> **H~1b~**: As the internal cohesion of a regime deteriorates, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society

Threats to a regime's institutional balance are not limited to domestic, internal events. Economic, political, military, ethnic, and humanitarian crises can spill over to neighboring states and can have a strong negative effect on a country's political stability and economic performance [@AdesChua:1997]. Beyond general political and military risk in neighboring countries, actual destabilizing events—in particular coups d'etat and popular protests—throughout a region likely influence a regime's decision making and survival strategy. Protests leading to regime change have a propensity to diffuse through a region—for instance, successful anti-regime protests in Egypt and Tunisia in 2011 triggered protests and unrest throughout the Middle East [@BamertGilardiWasserfallen:2015]. In particular, coups—either resulting from protests or military intervention—represent the worst-case scenario for autocrats working to maintain stability, as they *force* an irregular exit from power. According to data from @GoemansGleditschChiozza:2009, in the 100 countries I identify as autocracies, 790 executives have left office since 1950. In 240 cases, or nearly one third of all exits, the exit from office occurred irregularly (i.e. not due to term limits or natural death). A clear majority of these irregular collapses of executive power—182, or 75%—occurred as a result of military, political, or rebel coups. Coups are thus a notable threat for autocrats hoping to remain in power, and seeing coup activity in neighboring countries likely alters a regime's stability-maintaining calculus.

The second most common reason for unplanned autocratic exit is forced removal due to popular protest, seen in 21 cases—nearly 10%—of all irregular exits. While protests do not always lead to abdications of power, they can *threaten* to do so. Protests in neighboring countries are also a salient threat to stability, since, as seen during the string of revolutions and uprisings in the Middle East beginning in 2011, popular protests have a tendency to spread [@Kuran:1995; @Kuran:1989; @BamertGilardiWasserfallen:2015; @PatelBunceWolchik:2014]. Thus, regimes wary of the destabilizing influence of events outside their borders will attempt to insulate and protect themselves and change how they regulate domestic actors, leading to the following testable implications:

> **H~2a~**:  As domestic political instability increases in neighboring countries, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society at home

> **H~2b~**:  As coup activity in neighboring countries increases, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society at home

> **H~2c~**:  As popular protests in neighboring countries increase, the *more* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society at home

Finally, governments are not immune to outside influences. A growing body of research shows that states are quite concerned with their international reputations, and condemnation, shaming, and public pressure from abroad can induce changes in domestic policies [@Keck:1998; @Burgerman:2001]. Public reports and rankings issued by INGOs and governments can often have a direct effect on policies: studies have found that countries are more likely to criminalize human trafficking in response to the US State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons report [@KelleySimmons:2015; @Kelley:2017], more likely to undertake reforms that improve the ease of doing business in their countries [@KelleySimmonsDoshi:2017], more likely to conduct fair elections when monitored by foreign organizations [@Kelley:2012], less likely to receive foreign direct investment when condemned by INGOs [@BarryClayFlynn:2013], and more likely to respect human rights when cajoled and censured by INGOs [@Murdie:2012; @Murdie:2014a]. 

Anecdotal evidence shows that regimes also care about how their civil society regulations are perceived internationally. For example, as the government of Kazakhstan mulled over a more restrictive NGO law in 2005, US diplomats met with Kazakhstani officials and used the specter of international reputation to argue that "the best way for Kazakhstan to distinguish itself from its neighbors" was to respect international and domestic institutions, conduct fair presidential elections in 2006, and not pass the NGO law [@05ALMATY1938a]. Kazakhstan caved to the pressure and did not pass the law. In fact, promoting and maintaining their international reputation continued to be a strong driver of Kazakh policy thereafter. Throughout the mid-2000s, Kazakhstan worked to attain chairmanship over the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), with the explicit hope of showing off its "high international reputation," and the country received the position in 2010.[^2] This leads to my final hypothesis: 

> **H~3~**:  As international shaming and condemnation of a regime increases, the *less* autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society


# Data and methods

To test these hypotheses, I construct a new time-series, cross-sectional dataset of 100 autocracies from 1991–2014, compiling a set of variables from several well-established and new data sources. Most importantly, I offer a new index for measuring the overall level of de facto restrictiveness of a country's Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE).

## Integrating mixed methods with nested analysis

There are important differences in how dictators regulate domestic and international civil society. When dealing with *domestic* institutional challengers, dictators have a wide array of policy choices to manipulate and control their influence, ranging from formal legislation against certain activities to imprisoning and torturing recalcitrant legislators, judges, or activists. Autocrats have fewer options for controlling *international* actors, however, because of issues of jurisdiction, diplomacy, and global politics. While it may be relatively easy for a dictator to harass and imprison the family of a native activist, attempting to jail or torture international advocates or aid workers is far riskier, as foreigners often have the legal and political backing of their home states. Dictators have a more limited menu of policy levers for controlling INGOs.

That said, at a legal and administrative level, the laws that govern civil society tend to cover both domestic and international organizations, and regulations that are applied to international NGOs are often the same as those applied to domestic NGOs. With a few notable exceptions, regimes rarely craft legislation aimed primarily and exclusively at regulating *international* NGOs. Accordingly, there is unfortunately no systematic way to quantitatively disentangle the application of the civil society regulatory environment to domestic and international organizations. 

Measuring the determinants of *international* NGO restrictions, then, poses a methodological challenge—despite a host of cross-national data on autocratic institutionalization, no existing measure fully reflects the regulatory environment for INGOs. I address this challenge by employing nested analysis, an innovative research design strategy that tightly integrates large-*n* statistical work with detailed small-*n* case studies [@Lieberman:2005]. 

Nested analysis differs from the more classical mixed methods research strategy proposed by King, Keohane, and Verba [-@KingKeohaneVerba:1994]. At its core, this more classical approach combines regression results and case studies to triangulate a theory's causal effects, answering the same empirical question multiple times with multiple methods and confirming (or disproving) the findings of the quantitative analysis. In contrast, nested analysis is a form of integrative multi-method research and is part of the qualitative methodological movement succeeding King, Keohane, and Verba [@Mahoney:2010; @WellerBarnes:2014; @Seawright:2016]. The underlying logic in this type of research is integrative rather than triangulative. Instead of seeking convergence in the results of quantitative and qualitative work, there is a clear division of labor between the two methods. With an integrative design, a study answers an empirical question once using multiple nested methods to investigate different aspects of the underlying theory. The nested design allows for a sort of iterative folk Bayesianism [@McKeown:1999], since the prior hypotheses analyzed in the large-*n* analysis inform the posterior small-*n* case studies; hypotheses that are proven correct (or incorrect) with statistical modeling are investigated further with deeper qualitative analysis.

In the large-*n* analysis presented in this chapter, I test the robustness of my hypotheses using parsimonious models with minimal controls. Here I am less interested in precise effect sizes and more concerned with the overall trends of the various hypotheses and the predictive performance of the model I construct. In the following chapter, I use the results from this large-*n* model to select three cases—Egypt, China, and Russia—for more intense analysis of my hypothesized causal processes. The statistical findings of this chapter directly inform the qualitative work that follows, answering different aspects of the same question. That is, I qualitatively study the regulation of *international* NGOs in a *handful* of authoritarian regimes within a larger quantitative analysis of *all* NGOs in *all* authoritarian regimes. 

## Dependent variable

### Measuring civil society restrictions

Empirically measuring the severity and extent of civil society legal restrictions is difficult. Scholars have used a handful of measures, including the CIVICUS Civil Society Index (CSI),[^3] the Global Civil Society Index (GCSI),[^4] global and regional public opinion surveys, and the CIRI Human Rights Data Project,[^5] but each of these variables faces substantial issues with scope, validity, and consistency. 

The CSI evaluates domestic civil society structure and values using country experts' opinions regarding four dimensions,[^6] scores each dimension on a 1–3 scale, and provides a final summative index—countries with a higher score ostensibly have a stronger civil society sector. However, CSI data has been collected in a few 2–3 year waves in only 30–50 countries, and has not been updated since 2012, making it difficult to use in annual cross-sectional analysis. In 2004, the Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies created the GCSI as a rival index. Similar to the CSI, the GCSI rates civil society along three dimensions[^7] and provides a final summative index to represent the strength of a country's civil society. However, the GCSI has not been updated since 2004, and it only includes a handful of non-OECD countries, which makes it unsuitable for studying civil society in authoritarian regimes. 

Scholars have also used public opinion surveys such as the World Values Survey (WVS)[^8] or regional projects like the Arab Barometer,[^9] Afrobarometer,[^10] and Asian Barometer[^11] to measure and analyze individual perceptions of associational life and participation in domestic and international NGOs [@Jamal:2007; @Bernhard:2007]. However, these surveys are not conducted annually[^12] and, like the CSI and GCSI, are not suitable for large-*n*, country-level analysis. 

Finally, the CIRI Human Rights project provides indices of human rights restrictions based on close readings of annual US State Department *Country Reports on Human Rights Practices* [@CingranelliRichardsClay:2014]. Among the rights measured by CIRI is a measure of the restrictions on the freedom of assembly and association, or how easily citizens can participate in trade unions, cultural organizations, or domestic and international NGOs. Countries can receive one of three scores each year—severely restricted, limited, and unrestricted—based on the severity and universality of civil society restrictions within each country. CIRI data is available for nearly 200 countries annually since 1981, making it ideal for cross-sectional analysis. However, with only three possible outcomes the data is sluggish and not granular, and it fails to pick up on slight changes in the regulatory environment.

### The Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE) Index

These difficulties with data quality are not limited to civil society measures—many democracy-related indicators, including elections, judicial independence, and legislative activity, have spotty and inconsistent coverage over time and are not always reliable. A new project—the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)—however, attempts to address these issues. V-Dem uses a sophisticated Bayesian measurement model to aggregate existing published data and opinions from more than 2,500 country experts to provide hundreds of robust democracy-related indicators and indexes. Most importantly, in contrast with the CSI, GCSI, public opinion surveys, and CIRI, V-Dem indicators are available for most countries from 1900–2015 and display variation over time. 

V-Dem includes many variables related to the regulatory legal environment for civil society, including measures of entry and exit regulations, repression, participatory environment, and the level of women's participation in associational life. Scholars associated with V-Dem used these indicators to generate a Core Civil Society Index (CCSI), which measures the strength of civil society in a country given (1) the organizational environment for civil society organizations and (2) the level of citizen activism [@BernhardTzelgovJung:2015]. Following this lead, I construct my own Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE) index to measure only state constraints on civil society, ignoring citizen participation in associational life, based on the CCSI's indicators for civil society organizational environment: (1) the level of state repression of civil society organizations and (2) the level of state control over civil society organization entry and exit into public life. The CCSI was constructed by aggregating several V-Dem variables using Bayesian factor analysis; for the sake of simplicity, my CSRE index uses only a sum of the relevant V-Dem indicators.

While V-Dem's unique combination of Bayesian modeling and detailed expert opinion makes the CSRE index arguably more robust and reliable than any single measure, it also means that the index is more difficult to interpret, as it is essentially a sum of scale-less vectors of model point estimates. @fig:csre-top-bottom provides some helpful context for understanding this index, showing the average environment index for the five highest and lowest autocracies from 2000–2014. The index ranges between roughly −6 and 6, with more repressive countries receiving lower scores—the average index score for autocracies is 0.3, while democracies average 3.7.

![Mean CSRE for five highest and lowest autocracies from 2000–2014](../../Output/figures/1-csre-top-bottom){#fig:csre-top-bottom}

To test the validity of the CSRE, I compare it with data that tracks the *de jure* regulations on NGOs in dozens of countries. Newer research on NGO regulations has taken a different approach to measuring restrictions on civil society—instead of using country reports, public opinion surveys, or expert opinion to measure the general environment for civil society, scholars have begun to hand-code all legislation aimed at regulating or restricting specific aspects of NGO operations throughout the world. @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a and @ChristensenWeinstein:2013 have each collected remarkable data on regulations aimed at restricting *domestic* NGOs from registering, receiving foreign funding, or engaging in advocacy, noting the specific bills, decrees, and constitutional laws that prohibit these activities. These databases of legal restrictions are not as comprehensive as the data available from V-Dem: Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash include foreign funding restrictions in 45 countries from 1993–2012, while Christensen and Weinstein include funding, registration, and advocacy regulations in 98 countries from 1909–2012.

![Relationship between types of NGO legal barriers and the CSRE](../../Output/figures/1-csre-dcjw){#fig:csre-dcjw}

Because the data collected by Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash only includes one measure of civil society restriction for a smaller subset of countries, the relationship between their data and the CSRE is non-existent. However, as seen in @fig:csre-dcjw, Christensen and Weinstein's count of legal barriers for NGOs is negatively correlated with the CSRE and fits with the logic of the index. In most years, most countries tend to only have a minimal number of formal laws limiting civil society activity and, as shown by the superimposed locally weighted average curves, moving from no barriers to one barrier only decreases the CSRE marginally, since it is likely normal for governments to assert some sort of legal control over NGOs. But as the number of formal barriers increases beyond a minimal regulatory regime, the CSRE steadily worsens. The form of legal restriction appears to have differential effects on the overall regulatory environment. [@tbl:csre-dcjw-coefs] lists the coefficients from a simple linear model predicting the CSRE based on the number of legal barriers. The addition of any anti-NGO law predictably worsens the overall legal environment, but imposing barriers to advocacy appears to have a larger effect than advocacy or entry, most likely because such laws target a subset of NGOs that pose more of a potential threat to regime stability. The CSRE measure is correlated with the imposition of formal legal barriers to NGO activities, as expected, given that de facto NGO restrictions are enabled by de jure regulations. The CSRE has an advantage over a strict count of laws, though, since it captures volatility in how those laws have been enforced over time. The CSRE index is thus a valid—and arguably richer—measure of NGO restrictions.

## Explanatory variables

### Identifying autocracies

I use two different methods to identify autocracies. First, I use the Unified Democracy Score (UDS) scale to capture country-level democratization. Scholars have long used data from the Polity IV project [@MarshallJaggers:2014], which assigns democracy scores ranging from −10 to 10 and categorizes countries into one of three regime types based on those scores: autocracies (−10 to −6), anocracies (−5 to 5), and democracies (6 to 10). Though these categories of democratization are useful at large magnitudes (i.e. there is a clear difference between a country that scores a −8 on the Polity IV scale and one that scores a 6), marginal changes in democratization scores are often meaningless (i.e. a change from a level 5 anocracy to a level 6 democracy is rather imperceptible and more susceptible to rater subjectivity). The UDS scale was created in 2010 to address the uncertainty inherent in measuring democratization [@PemsteinMeserveMelton:2010]. This scale uses Bayesian estimation and simulation to generate aggregate democracy scores based on 10 other standard measurement scales (including Polity IV). Instead of assigning each country a single score, the UDS provides every country-year with a posterior score distribution ranging from −2 to 2, with more democratic nations receiving higher scores. For the sake of analytic simplicity, I use a cutoff point of zero to roughly classify countries as democracies and autocracies, resulting in 86 authoritarian regimes.

Classifying regime type with an arbitrary numeric threshold is convenient, but can lead to substantial analytic issues. In their research on autocratic breakdown, @GeddesWrightFrantz:2014 found that in previous studies on autocratic breakdowns, using Polity thresholds as a proxy for autocracy overestimated predictions of regime survival by 100 percent, indicating that Polity's parsimony and simplicity fails to capture the nuances of autocratic rule. Accordingly, I also identify autocracies using data from @GeddesWrightFrantz:2014, who categorize 154 countries as various varieties of autocracies, including oligarchies, monarchies, and various combinations of personal, party, and military rule. 

These two approaches to identifying regime type yield slightly different categorizations—there are 89 countries with UDS scores below zero and 86 countries labeled as autocracies by Geddes, et al. To address this discrepancy and find the widest possible definition of autocracy, I include all countries that appear in either dataset, resulting in 100 states.[^13] For the sake of completeness, I consider a country to be autocratic if it has ever been categorized as such since 1991, meaning that countries that democratize or backslide are included. 

### Domestic conflict and regime cohesion

I hypothesize that political stability and internal regime conflict predict restrictions on civil society. I measure two sources of regime stability: domestic political stability and government cohesion. First, I use data from Political Risk Services' International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) to measure the internal risk and stability of a regime [@Political-Risk-Services:2014]. ICRG provides a monthly political risk rating for 143 countries based on a weighted collection of indicators, including government stability, corruption, ethnic tensions, and conflict.[^14] Risk ratings range from 0–100, with the most stable countries receiving the highest scores, and the most unstable countries ranking around 30–40. As I am interested in *domestic* regime stability, I omit the subcomponent of the score measuring external conflict, and to avoid issues with collinearity, I omit the subcomponent measuring democratic accountability, since I use other indicators of democracy, explained below. Having removed these subcomponents, I rescale the risk score to have a maximum of 100 to generate a final internal political risk index.[^15] Finally in the interest of clarity, because the term "risk" carries negative connotations and the ICRG risk index increases as stability improves (i.e. as a country's risk score improves, political conditions improve), I redefine domestic political *risk* as domestic *political stability*. Second, I use the ICRG subindicator for government cohesion on its own, as it captures instability within the ruling regime itself.

![Changes in ICRG domestic political stability and government cohesion indexes over time](../../Output/figures/1-icrg-examples){#fig:icrg-examples}

To demonstrate how shifts in domestic political stability and government cohesion are actually represented, @fig:icrg-examples shows these values for three authoritarian states: Qatar and Somalia, which have the maximum and minimum values of stability, respectively, and Syria, which has seen the most volatility. In the 10 years prior to the Syrian war, the country dropped 10 points in its domestic stability score, representative of a slow deterioration and stagnation of internal stability. Syria's government cohesion during this time remained relatively high and constant, however. From 2010–2014, the country dropped nearly 20 points in domestic political stability, and its government cohesion dropped to roughly the same level as Somalia. Few countries have seen such dramatic and precipitous drops in stability scores—in general, across all autocratic states between 2000–2014, the average difference between minimum and maximum domestic stability scores was 10.6 and the average difference in government cohesion scores was 3.7. 

Beyond aggregate regime stability, I include several variables directly related to domestic political institutions. I measure how many consecutive years the executive has been in office with data from the World Bank's Database of Political Institutions [@BeckClarkeGroff:2001], which indicates the longevity of the regime. I also include measures of regime competitiveness. Using data from the National Elections Across Democracy and Autocracy (NELDA) project [@HydeMarinov:2012], I calculate the number of years that have passed since a country held a competitive election. Following @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a, I consider an election competitive if opposition parties were allowed to participate, if more than one political party was legal, and if the ballot provided voters with a choice of candidates. I also count the vote share won by the largest opposition party, as measured by the Database of Political Institutions [@BeckClarkeGroff:2001].

### Stability of neighboring countries

I also hypothesize that external stability affects civil society restrictions within states. That is, when a regime observes general instability, coups, and popular protests in nearby countries, it will crack down on associational life and increase restrictions on civil society in an effort to minimize domestic institutional dissonance. I measure a country's exposure to external risk and conflict using the 0–100 domestic ICRG political stability score (described above) of all other countries weighted by distance.[^16] Weighting risk by distance permits me to assume that the level of internal stability in countries closest to a given state has the greatest bearing on that regime's behavior, while also allowing for more distant unrest to influence a regime's decisions. 

To supplement the more general measure of ICRG stability, I include data on the number of coups and popular protests in neighboring countries. I measure the level of coup activity by counting all successful and unsuccessful coups in a state's neighbors in each year [@PowellThyne:2011]. I define a country's neighbors to include all states within 900 km of the closest border, rather than including only states that share a contiguous border [@Gleditsch:2002]. I do not use the overall weighted average of coups, assuming that coup activity in distant states has little effect on a given regime (i.e. coups in Sierra Leone are not likely to worry officials in Tajikistan).

In contrast to the readily available (and more easily countable) data on coup activity, measuring protests is more difficult. In an attempt to quantify global protest activity, I use event data methods to construct new measures of violent and nonviolent protests in a given state. Event data uses computational natural language text algorithms to parse a text and determine *who* did *what* to *whom* *where* and *when*. After feeding millions of news media stories into this algorithm, the resulting data identifies the main actors, actions, and locations in a story, and can be used to track any number of events of interest. I use event data from DARPA's Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS),[^17] which tracks more than 14 million events from 1995 to 2016 and includes nearly 180,000 instances of both nonviolent and violent protest across the 100 autocracies I have selected.[^18] 

However, using these events in a statistical model is not a straightforward task. Because media reports form the foundation of ICEWS, event data is by nature biased by the quantity of media coverage. Using a raw count of events in each country is not possible, since larger, more covered countries will inherently see more events. Conversely, dividing the count of events of interest by the total number of events in a country to create a percent-based index results in a measure that is biased towards less-covered countries. For example, ICEWS records only two events in Barbados in 2015, one of which was a nonviolent protest, meaning that a simple ratio would show that half of all events that year were protests. 

Instead of using counts or ratios, I generate a standardized measure by centering and rescaling the count of events of interest in each country over time, resulting in a variable that ranges roughly between 1 and 5—a value around 1 indicates that a country experienced fewer events of interest in a year than what they typically see, while a 5 indicates that it experienced far more than normal.[^19] @fig:protests-egypt-china provides an example of this rescaled measure, showing absolute and relative protest activity in both China and Egypt. China's low and steady hum of nonviolent protests remains roughly constant over the time period, with a spike in 2008 due to both the Tibetan uprising and the Olympic games. Violent protests peaked in 2012 due to ongoing tensions in Tibet and nationwide anti-Japanese protests. The standardization process scales both of these peaks to roughly five. A similar pattern occurs in Egypt, with a small uptick in protest activity in 2005 due to the country's first competitive presidential election, and a significant spike during the Arab Spring in 2011–2013. Though the counts of events are not comparable between the two countries, the standardized measure can be used across countries, showing here that the rapid increases in protests were indeed unexpected. 

![Protest events in Egypt and China—raw counts and standardized index](../../Output/figures/1-protests-egypt-china){#fig:protests-egypt-china}

As with the general ICRG-based measure of neighbor instability, I calculated the distance-weighted average for protests, since the reverberations of protests can be felt further off. Whereas a regime observing a faraway *coup* will not likely worry as much about contagion, the costs of participating in *popular protests* are generally lower than outright revolution and media coverage of foreign protests is more readily available, thus increasing the likelihood that dissidents will protest against the government.

### International shaming

Finally, I argue that reputational concerns influence an autocrat's decision to regulate civil society. Notably, this hypothesis only accounts for reactive condemnation, or shaming that *succeeds* a regime's violation of international norms. In the previous example of Kazakhstan, reputation was wielded preemptively and *preceded* (and possibly prevented) a norm violation. Detecting preemptive reputational shaming, though, requires access to documents and data that are generally impossible to find. @Kelley:2017 creatively relies on the 2009 Wikileaks dump of US State Department cables to trace the US's behind-the-scenes preemptive shaming in its global fight against human trafficking. However, locating instances of NGO-related shaming in Wikileaks cables is more difficult, especially given that the global crackdown on civil society began in earnest after Chelsea Manning had leaked her cache of documents. Additionally, as discussed previously, a growing body of research has shown that countries adjust their behavior in response to international shaming. In these studies, shaming has typically been tied to specific reports, scores, and rankings issued by states, IGOs, and NGOs regarding specific policy issues. Unfortunately, however, no country, IGO, or NGO publishes any index related to civil society repression. 

Since I cannot measure international shaming related to regimes' treatment of civil society specifically, I generate a more general measure that captures the overall level of international condemnation faced by a country. Previous research on media and politics has identified a "CNN effect" where increased international coverage of humanitarian disasters can encourage states to intervene [@Robinson:2011]. @MurdiePeksen:2014 find a similar effect for INGOs and use event data to show that more conflictual events between INGOs and states raise the likelihood for armed foreign humanitarian interventions. Under the assumption that heightened media coverage of international condemnation represents a more general form of shaming, I identify roughly 80,000 events in ICEWS where a state source condemns a state target in the 100 countries identified as autocracies.[^20] As with the measures of protest activity in neighboring countries, I center and rescale the count of shaming events in each country, where 1 indicates less shaming than normal and 5 indicates substantially more.

## Modeling decisions

Instead of testing my hypotheses with frequentist null hypothesis significance testing (NHST), the standard statistical approach in much of the existing research on international relations and comparative politics, I estimate a series of Bayesian generalized linear models. I use Bayesian methods primarily because they yield more meaningful inferences [@Kruschke:2010; @Korner-NievergeltRothFelten:2015; @GelmanCarlinStern:2013]. Frequentist NHST analysis determines the *probability of the data* given a *null hypothesis* (i.e. $P(\text{data} | H_0)$), yielding results that are often unwieldy, phrased as the probability of rejecting the null if it is true. In contrast, Bayesian analysis determines the *probability of a hypothesis* given *the data* (i.e. $P(H | \text{data})$), resulting in probabilities that are directly interpretable, phrased simply as the probability that the hypothesis is true. Similarly, Bayesian analysis provides more interpretable measures of uncertainty. Given frequentist-estimated parameters, we can calculate a 95% confidence interval that indicates that if the data were generated several more times, 95% of the resulting confidence intervals would contain the true parameter.[^21] With Bayesian methods, uncertainty can be described with a credible interval, which simply indicates that we can be 95% sure that the true parameter is with that interval. Bayesian analysis is not a silver bullet for inference—the linear models I fit must still be well specified and fit standard statistical assumptions (i.e. homoskedasticity of errors, absence multicollinearity, etc.). However, the framework usefully provides a more interpretable set of results.

I use weakly informative prior distributions for each of the coefficient parameters, based on a Cauchy distribution with a location of 0 and a scale of 1. I obtain the posterior distribution of the CSRE with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and simulate values from the joint posterior distribution of the coefficient parameters.[^22] I use the medians of the simulated values from the MCMC samples as coefficient estimates, and use the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles as lower and upper limits for 95% credible intervals. Finally, I declare an effect statistically significant if the posterior probability of being different from zero is larger than 0.95. However, I only discuss significance as a frequentist convenience. Because Bayesian models estimate the probability of a given hypothesis, there is no need to construct significance thresholds for rejecting null hypotheses. When reporting the probabilities for estimates, I provide the posterior probability that the estimate is greater than zero.[^23] For the sake of consistency, when estimates are below zero, I do not reverse the inequality sign, resulting in low probabilities.[^24] A completely null result would yield a *p*-value of 0.5; "significance" throughout this analysis thus lies in the tails (0–0.05 and 0.95–1). 

As discussed previously, I employ model-building large-*n* analysis (LNA), which entails parsimonious model specification with minimal controls. I lead the CSRE by one year in each model to capture the lagged effect of all dependent variables, and I include year fixed effects as the only control variable.[^25] While this is admittedly a rough and naive identification strategy, these models are ultimately meant to demonstrate the conjoint determinants of the civil society regulatory environment in general, and not a precisely estimated treatment effect. Again, these results inform and complement the small-*n* analysis (SNA) of the following chapters, where I explore each causal mechanism in more depth.

# Results

@fig:coefs-bayes presents the estimates of two different model specifications. In the basic, most parsimonious model, I measure the effect of internal determinants using only domestic political risk and government cohesion measures, external determinants using only coups and protest activity in neighboring countries, and reputational determinants using the relative measure of international shaming. In the alternate model, I include additional measures of regime stability and longevity as internal determinants and a more general distance-weighted measure of neighbor instability. The full results of both models are included in [@tbl:results-basic] and [@tbl:results-alternate] in the appendix.

![Determinants of the civil society regulatory environment. Points indicate median estimates of β; error bars indicate 95% credible interval](../../Output/figures/1-coefs-bayes){#fig:coefs-bayes}

## Internal determinants

I begin by examining my first hypothesis—that autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society more as they face more instability within their countries in general and within their regime specifically. In both model specifications, increased domestic stability is associated with improved scores in the CSRE in the following year, meaning that CSRE is less restrictive in more stable countries. For every unit increase in the rescaled domestic stability index, the CSRE increases by approximately 0.05 points, which is a small but potentially potent change, given that the stability index ranges from 0–100 and countries typically see more sizable changes in their stability over time. The left panel of @fig:int-pred demonstrates this cumulative effect visually, showing the predicted CSRE across the range of possible political stability scores, with all other model parameters held at their mean values. All else equal, by only varying domestic political stability, the CSRE can move from 0 to 3 (or vice versa, as stability decreases). There is therefore strong evidence in favor of H~1a~ ($P(\beta > 0) = 1$)—the CSRE is more restricted in countries facing instability and conflict, and conversely, civic space is more open and free in countries with greater domestic stability.

![(L) Predicted CSRE across range of possible domestic stability scores; (R) predicted CSRE across range of government cohesion scores and length of executive tenure. All model covariates held at their means.](../../Output/figures/1-int-pred){#fig:int-pred}

The model offers contradictory evidence for H~1b~, however. I had hypothesized that autocrats would restrict the CSRE as the internal cohesion of the regime deteriorated. However, across both specifications of the model, autocratic government stability is significantly and *negatively* associated with the CSRE in the following year, resulting in a decrease of nearly 0.2 ($P(\beta > 0) = 0$). That is, as a regime consolidates its power and internal unity, it does not, in fact, increase the space for institutional dissonance for civil society organizations. Instead, it appears that autocratic entrenchment and stabilization leads to a more restrictive regulatory environment. 

The three additional measures of regime longevity bolster this evidence. Executive tenure is significantly and negatively associated with civil society regulations, and for every year in office, the CSRE will decrease by 0.1 on average ($P(\beta > 0) = 0$). The number of years that elapse between competitive executive elections has a similar effect, decreasing the CSRE by nearly 0.05 each year, *ceteris paribus*. The right panel of @fig:int-pred shows the substantial effects of these coefficients, demonstrating the predicted CSRE across a range of possible government cohesion values for countries with executives in office for 2 and 30 years. Contra my hypothesis, the CSRE clearly worsens both when regime cohesion increases and as autocrats remain in office longer.

Finally, the share of votes won by the opposition party is associated with an improved CSRE ($\beta$ = 0.4; $P(\beta > 0) = 1$). This may indicate a degree of endogeneity in the model—autocratic regimes with more electoral competition are more likely to have better, more open civil societies, regardless of executive tenure—but it is still a useful indication of regime behavior towards institutions. In countries where institutionalization is encouraged or allowed (i.e. where opposition parties win elections), other institutions such as civil society benefit, while countries with minimal institutionalization are more likely to have executives with longer tenure and, correspondingly, more restricted civil society.

The results from the models have fascinating implications for the hypothesis. As expected, more domestic instability is indeed associated with a worse environment in the following year, a sign that dictators clamp down on institutional dissonance when facing domestic crises. Unexpectedly however, the CSRE tends to worsen as regimes become more cohesive and remain in power longer. While this goes against my hypothesis, it reveals insight into the importance of civil society as an institutional actor—civil society is possibly one of the first institutions to be jettisoned as autocrats figure out the appropriate level of dissonance. Because they have not yet consolidated their power or mastered the balance of domestic institutions, young, less cohesive regimes tend to allow for more institutional dissonance, working with parliament, holding more competitive elections, and allowing for more civic space. As I show in the next chapter, the civil society regulatory environment in Egypt was more open and accessible in the early days of both the caretaker military government (SCAF) and President Morsi. As they consolidated their power and faced increasing domestic tension, though, both SCAF and Morsi were better able to move against civil society. SCAF did not raid Western NGOs until the end of 2011, after having invited these INGOs months earlier, and Morsi did not propose draft laws until near the end of his term. President Sisi, on the other hand, rode into power on a massive wave of popular and military support following Morsi's overthrow in 2013, and because his regime has been more cohesive from the start, he has regulated civil society more harshly already than either of his predecessors. Civil society therefore likely factors in a regime's stability-seeking calculus, but only in a more ancillary way—as regimes gain more internal cohesion and remain in power longer, they face less of a need to remain open to institutions with less political power and can thereby constrict the CSRE. 

## External risk

In my second hypothesis I propose that increased political risks in a state's neighboring countries are associated with a decrease in the CSRE in the following year. I test the effect of regional instability in two ways, using counts of coups and protest activity in the basic model with  a more generalized measure of neighboring instability in the alternate model. The ICRG political stability of a country's neighbors, weighted by distance, has a clear negative effect on the civil society regulatory environment in the following year, lowering the index by 0.04 points ($P(\beta > 0) = 0$) for every unit increase in average neighboring stability. While this effect is small, it again has a powerful cumulative effect, and countries experiencing wide swings in neighborhood stability are expected to open the space for civil society. The downward trend in the left panel of @fig:ext-pred makes this trend clear as the CSRE index drops. Notably, this finding goes contrary to H~2a~, showing that autocrats restrict the regulatory environment for civil society as political stability in neighboring country *improves*, not worsens. As with the effect of government cohesion and consolidation, autocrats again behave differently than anticipated, restricting the CSRE at home when they feel safe in the region. I explore possible reasons for this divergence below.

![(L) Predicted CSRE across range of possible distance-weighted overall risk scores, with and without coup activity; (R) predicted CSRE across range of possible levels of violent and nonviolent protest activity. All model covariates held at their means.](../../Output/figures/1-ext-pred){#fig:ext-pred}

The general ICRG-based measure of neighboring regime stability captures a range of possible sources of instability, including corruption, military involvement in politics, ethnic conflict, and civil wars. Under the assumption that different types of instability matter more to autocratic stability-seeking calculus, I hypothesize that coups and protests in neighboring countries have an effect on the CSRE. In both model specifications, coup activity is associated with an improved regulatory environment—the presence of an attempted or successful coup in a close neighbor increases the CSRE by approximately 0.5 in the following year ($P(\beta > 0) = 1$). The difference between the two lines in the left panel of @fig:ext-pred shows this effect, with countries seeing coup activity receiving higher predicted CSRE scores. Again, this finding goes contrary to hypothesized expectations, revealing the opposite of H~2b~—in general, autocrats *expand* the regulatory environment for civil society when there are nearby coups.

Protests in the region are correlated with the CSRE, but in different ways. In both model specifications increased relative violent protest activity in the region is negatively associated with civil society regulations, indicating that autocrats constrict the CSRE as they witness violent protests among their peer nations. More violent protests than normal results in a drop in the CSRE of roughly 0.2 ($P(\beta > 0) = 0.02$ in basic model; $P(\beta > 0) = 0.15$ in alternate model). Conversely, autocrats expand the environment when witnessing nearby nonviolent protests—unusually high levels of nonviolent protest activity in the region is associated with an increase in the CSRE of 0.5 ($P(\beta > 0) = 1$), roughly the same magnitude of change seen when there are coups. The right panel of @fig:ext-pred demonstrates the divergent effect of distance-weighted violent and nonviolent protest activity. These findings add some complexity to H~2c~, demonstrating that autocrats restrict the civil society regulatory environment in response to *violent* popular protests in neighboring countries, but expand that environment in response to *nonviolent* protests.

As with internal regime cohesion, autocrats behave differently than expected when facing external threats. According to the model, an average authoritarian regime does not generally restrict the civil society regulatory environment when facing regional unrest. The CSRE tends to be higher when there is more instability, more coups, and more nonviolent protests in neighboring countries. This phenomenon contributes a possible corollary to research by @Weiss:2014, who shows that China selectively represses and allows popular protests at home according to a balance of government needs. If protests are too costly to repress and risk turning against the government, the regime allows them to happen (albeit under a degree of supervision and control), thus allowing for a type of pressure valve [@Weiss:2014, 227]. Protests and popular unrest abroad are inherently impossible to repress—an autocrat in one country has little control over revolutions next door—and as such, autocrats allow for increased dissonance at home, including conceding more space for civil society and NGOs. 

Importantly, managing this pressure valve is dangerous. Weiss argues that viewing regime permissiveness as a pressure valve understates the danger that increased dissonance can pose to a regime stability-seeking calculus: "Valves can break," Weiss stresses, "with potentially disastrous consequences" [@Weiss:2014, 227]. In 2011, President Mubarak permitted greater civic space in the early days of the Arab Spring uprising and did not initially stop the mass protests, having just watched his Tunisian counterpart lose power in a coup. As the mix of institutional actors became more complicated and difficult to balance, though, his pressure valve strategy unravelled and he was forced to resign [@Heiss:2012]. The fact that the model shows that the CSRE is more restricted when there are violent protests (as hypothesized) potentially shows that autocrats are aware of the risks of using pressure valves—as long as neighboring protests are nonviolent, civic space at home can be permissive, but once protests turn violent, autocrats crack down locally to prevent the unrest from spreading and to stop the valve from bursting. The CSRE therefore again plays an important role in maintaining regime stability and longevity, but in manner more nuanced than predicted.

## Shaming

Finally, in my third hypothesis, I posit that autocrats expand the regulatory environment for civil society as international shaming and condemnation of their regime increases. The evidence for this hypothesis is inconclusive, however. In the basic model, an increase in relative state-based shaming is associated with a lower CSRE index in the following year ($\beta$ = −0.22; $P(\beta > 0) = 0$), suggesting that autocrats respond to shaming with additional restrictions. However, when accounting for regime-based characteristics such as time in office and the competitiveness of elections, this effect reverses, indicating that the CSRE improves in response to increased relative shaming ($\beta$ = 0.11, $P(\beta > 0) = 0.95$). Both effects are substantially different from zero, but they are not consistent across models. @fig:shaming-pred shows this uncertainty, with the CSRE alternately improving and worsening depending on model specification. Given these findings, there is no conclusive support for or against H~3~.

# Discussion

Civil society, both domestic and international, behaves as an institution within authoritarian regimes, and accordingly, is one of the many institutional challengers that dictators must control and balance to remain in power. In an effort to curb the potential destabilizing risks associated with civil society organizations, autocrats limit civil society through legislation and regulations. The severity and restrictiveness of this regulatory environment is likely a function of a regime's cohesion and domestic stability, the level of stability and conflict in a regime's neighboring countries, and a regime's concerns over its international reputation. The results of this large-*n* statistical analysis contradict many of my initial hypotheses, but they reveal important nuances in the determinants of institutional treatment of civil society as a strategy for maintaining autocratic stability. [@tbl:hypothesis-summary] summarizes each of the principal findings from this analysis.

Following my first hypothesis, autocrats should restrict civil society more in the face of instability at home. These basic models provide conflicting evidence for this assertion. Following H~1a~, the domestic political stability of a country is clearly positively associated with civil society regulations. States facing political, economic, ethic, and social crises and other direct threats to regime survival are more likely to crack down on domestic and international civil society, while states facing calmer domestic politics are more likely to make concessions to civil society and allow for more institutional dissonance. Internal government cohesion (H~1b~), on the other hand, plays a countervailing role in the calculus to restrict civil society. Regimes that are more unified, stable, and durable appear to have sufficient political capital to safely impose restrictions on civil society.

According to my second hypothesis, fears of contagion from instability in neighboring countries should lead an autocrat to restrict civil society. However, as autocrats witness political instability and violence in their neighbors, they have an incentive to make concessions to civil society and expand the regulatory environment for NGO activity. Coups (H~2b~), nonviolent protests (H~2c~), and general political instability (H~2a~) abroad likely encourage autocrats to permit increased institutional dissonance at home as a hedging mechanism or pressure valve, heading off the threat of contagion by allowing for more robust associational life. Conversely, as with internal regime cohesion, having more stable and safe neighbors appears to provide autocrats with cover to impose more restrictions on civil society. Finally, autocrats react to violent protests differently (H~2c~), as these likely represent a more immediate threat to contagion and a risk to the safety valve. While the influence of nonviolent protests abroad can be offset by permitting additional institutional dissonance at home, violent protests have a higher likelihood of leading to regime change and thus result in a more constricted regulatory environment. After coups in neighboring countries—the assumed endgame of violent protests—are a *fait accompli*, it appears that autocrats attempt to mitigate future diffusion by expanding the CSRE. 

Finally, there is no conclusive support for or against the hypothesis that concerns over international reputation influence the decision to expand or constrict institutional dissonance. Formal, high-level diplomatic shaming and condemnation from other states is not consistently associated with changes in the regulatory environment for civil society. This null result could indicate that international shaming truly has no effect on a country's CSRE, but it is more likely an artifact of the data. Susceptibility to shaming is subtle and difficult to detect. Preemptive shaming through diplomatic efforts are typically unobservable (except when leaked cables reveal them), and instances of reactive shaming to specific anti-NGO crackdowns are difficult to systematically count or measure.

While these findings provide strong statistical evidence for some of the institutional determinants of authoritarian civil society restrictions, other results run contrary to what I had hypothesized. Within a nested analytical approach, though, such contradictory findings are welcome and provide grist for deeper small-*n* case studies that investigate these causal mechanisms further—these correct (and incorrect) hypotheses allow for iterative folk Bayesianism [@McKeown:1999] by adjusting my prior beliefs for in-depth qualitative analysis. Before connecting these results to the larger argument of determining what influences a regime's decision to expand or constrict its civil society regulatory environment, we must first examine these divergent findings in paradigmatic cases of international civil society restrictions.

[^18]:	I use the machine-coded classification of events, or CAMEO codes, to identify protests, with *nonviolent protests* = general political dissent (CAMEO code 140), demonstrate or rally (141\*), hunger strike (142\*), strike or boycott (143\*), and obstruct passage, block (144\*), and *violent protests* = protest violently or riot (145\*).

[^21]:	It is often tempting to interpret frequentist confidence intervals in a Bayesian manner.

[^25]:	In the spirit of estimating as parsimonious a model as possible, I omit country fixed effects. I would also omit year fixed effects, but because time is built into the model (i.e. because the lag of the dependent variable is included as an independent variable), I account for year-specific with year fixed effects. The estimates from the following models are thus time-invariant averages across all countries.
