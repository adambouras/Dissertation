# The institutional dynamics of civil society in authoritarian regimes

## Civil society as a political institution

The idea of a civil society has long been salient, with commentators as early as De Tocqueville theorizing on the importance of groups of citizens that actively engage with their governments to advocate for reform, rights, change, and other services. Civil society is traditionally defined as "an agglomeration of private, voluntary organizations that have the capacity to assert the rights of individuals and groups," [@Cook:2007, 143] and is most commonly operationalized as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), or organizations that operate outside of both the private and public sectors, ostensibly filling social gaps left by firms and governments [@AhmedPotter:2006, 30; see also @Hansmann:1980]. Civil society need not be explicitly political or rights-focused—any sort of association, including bowling clubs and parent/teacher associations, allows citizens to come in contact with each other, build social capital, and aggregate individual preferences [@Putnam:1994].

Given this wide range of possible civil society organizations, ranging from neighborhood book clubs to international human rights advocacy NGOs, it has been difficult to address civil society in a consistent theoretical way. To address this, I propose that we can gain significant analytic and theoretical insight into the purpose and function of civil society by analyzing the sector through an institutionalist lens. While formal institutional theory has typically been applied to more traditional institutions such as constitutions, electoral systems, legislative committee assignments, or judiciary structures, these theories can be usefully applied to non-traditional political phenomena like civil society. In particular, institutional theory allows us to see how civil society as an institution lowers transaction costs and promotes coordinated collective action against or in support of the state. 

Simply put, institutions are the collection of rules that define the parameters of social activity, or the "humanly devised constraints that shape human interactions" [@North:1990, 3]. These "rules of the game" dictate who can make decisions, which actions are allowed or prohibited, and how obedience is rewarded and disobedience punished [@Ostrom:1990, 51]. Institutions can range from formal structures like constitutions and property ownership regimes to informal social and cultural norms, practices, and traditions. Ultimately, institutions—both formal and informal—gain traction in society because they reduce the transaction costs of social and economic interaction. When players interact, they can trust that their counterparts will behave appropriately because of the rules of the underlying institutional framework.^[This trust can also be described in game theoretic terms as a state of equilibrium, where institutional arrangements structure the payoffs such that players have little incentive to move [@Weingast:1997; @Greif:2004; @Calvert:1995].] 

Treating civil society as an institution yields the greatest theoretical advantage when considering how civil society organizations and NGOs lower transaction costs by solving difficult collective action problems and public goods dilemmas. Civil society has typically been defined in one of two ways.^[Defined as "Civil Society I" and "Civil Society II" by @FoleyEdwards:1996.] The first school of thought, championed by @Putnam:1994, holds that vibrant associational life forges links that cross social boundaries—bowling clubs, parent/teacher associations, neighborhood groups, volunteer organizations, and other nonprofit groups tend to include members from multiple social strata, thereby breaking down vertical social boundaries and increasing social trust. This associational life increases civic engagement, embeds norms of reciprocity into society, and helps improve democratic governance—in other words, civil society ultimately *strengthens and bolsters* the state.^[Antonio Gramsci offers a bleaker view, arguing that civil society actually contributes to "a more subtle and sophisticated form of state power"—one that "serves as an outer perimeter of defense for a hegemonic state" [@Cook:2007, 7, 143].]

In contrast, others have argued that civil society should stand *in opposition to* the state. The deeper social connections formed by participating in associational life can allow members of these organizations to "stand up to city hall" [@Jamal:2007, 4], to pursue their community self-interests, or to help maintain moral order and social norms. In this view, civil society organizations act as watchdogs against the government (or private sector), providing members of society with a focal point for popular mobilization. While discussing the institutional foundation for public morality—norms that shape the preferences and payoffs for players in a society—Platteau argues:

> A civil society helps to back trust whenever there is a sufficient number of citizens who feel vengeful enough to work towards exposing publicly the illegal acts or malpractices of both private and state agents, and towards bringing enough pressure to sanction them even though such actions entail significant costs to themselves (by denouncing economic crimes they produce a public good) [@Platteau:2000, 308].

@Weingast:1997 provides a more general explanation of how civil society's denouncement of government abuses can be seen as an institutional public good. Institutions prevent rulers from infringing on the rights of their citizens by organizing a "coordinated understanding" of the violation of those rights and allowing citizens to more easily coordinate and respond to potential abuses. That is, when citizens face government abuse, they face a coordination dilemma—they must convince other citizens to band with them to seek redress against the government, which is often difficult. Institutions solve this coordination dilemma in two ways: (1) institutions such as constitutions, legal structures, and civil society provide mechanisms that allow citizens to initially seek redress (e.g. an aggrieved citizen has a constitutional right to sue the government; nonprofit organizations are legally allowed to provide community services the government may be unable to deliver, etc.), and (2) those institutions generate a coordinated understanding—or the expectation that something must and shall be done to address government abuses—among a nation's citizens [@Weingast:1997, 262]. Non-aggrieved citizens assist those who are victims of government abuse because (1) there are institutions in place that allow for redress, and (2) the citizens who are not victims expect that the current victims will come to their aid in the future. Because of this ability to rally popular support for collective action, civil society can be seen as a critical watchdog against government and private sector abuses and thereby protect citizens against the state.

## Authoritarian regimes and institutional balancing

It is clear that civil society can be seen both skeptically (that it serves only to build the state) or optimistically (that it serves only to protect against the state). However, it is perhaps more useful to treat civil society as simply an institutional vehicle for coordinating collective action. As an institution, civil society can exert influence on a regime, pressuring and shaming it to follow specific norms. Conversely, it can also be directed, co-opted, or controlled by the state to help ensure a regime's survival.

A growing literature on the nuances of autocracy has begun to show that authoritarianism is not simply a transitional phase before democracy, but an altogether distinct regime type where autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010]. This newer theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that authoritarians are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism becomes a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can create narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage. Regimes can also create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to create popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this devolution of control to third parties—many of which can be actively opposed to the regime—creates an interesting competitive dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

Ultimately, civil society institutions play a dynamic role in authoritarian regimes and are not simply window dressing. As with other political institutions, civil society aggregates social preferences and creates a focal point, or coordinated understanding, that allows citizens to engage with the state in a coordinated manner. However, it is important to not overstate civil society's potential to challenge the state, as authoritarian leaders can influence the sector to ensure regime stability. The relationship between the state and civil society is bidirectional—domestic and international NGOs can act as anti-government watchdogs or as enablers of the regime, depending on how strategic the state is in capturing or co-opting or how effective NGOs are at avoiding that influence.

{Bring this in from other papers}


# Data and methods

To determine the relationship between internal regime stability, the stability and risk of neighboring countries, international shaming, and the restrictiveness of the *regulatory* environment for global civil society, I construct a new time-series, cross-sectional dataset of 143 countries from 1991–2014, compiling a set of variables from several well established and innovative data sources.

## Dependent variable

Systematically measuring the severity and extent of civil society legal restrictions is a difficult task. There are a handful of measures that scholars have used, including the CIVICUS Civil Society Index (CSI),[^1] the Global Civil Society Index (GCSI),[^2] global and regional public opinion surveys, and the CIRI Human Rights Data Project,[^3] but each variable faces substantial issues with validity and consistency. 

The CSI evaluates domestic civil society structure and values using country experts' opinions regarding four dimensions,[^4] scores each dimension on a 1–3 scale, and provides a final summative index—countries with a higher score ostensibly have a stronger civil society sector. However, CSI data has been collected in a handful 2–3 year waves for only 30–50 countries, and has not been updated since 2012, making it difficult to use in annual cross-sectional analysis. In 2004, the Johns Hopkins Center for Civil Society Studies created the GCSI as a rival index. Similar to the CSI, the GCSI rates civil society along three dimensions[^5] and provides a final summative index to represent the strength of a country's civil society. However, the GCSI has not been updated since 2004, and it only includes a handful of non-OECD countries, which makes it unsuitable for studying civil society in authoritarian regimes. 

Scholars have also used public opinion surveys such as the World Values Survey (WVS)[^6] or regional projects like the Arab Barometer,[^7] Afrobarometer,[^8] and Asian Barometer[^9] to measure and analyze individual perceptions of associational life and participation in domestic and international NGOs [@Jamal:2007; @Bernhard:2007]. However, these surveys are not conducted annually (the WVS is done every 5 years; regional barometers are done every 3–5 years) and like the CSI and GCSI, are not suitable for large-*N*, country-level analysis. 

Finally, the CIRI Human Rights project provides indices of human rights restrictions based on close readings of annual US State Department *Country Reports on Human Rights Practices* [@CingranelliRichardsClay:2014]. Among the rights measured by CIRI is a measure of the restrictions on the freedom of assembly and association, or how easily citizens can participate in trade unions, cultural organizations, or domestic and international NGOs. Countries can receive one of three scores each year—severely restricted, limited, and unrestricted—based on the severity and universality of civil society restrictions within each country. CIRI data is available for nearly 200 countries annually since 1981, making it ideal for cross-sectional analysis. However, with only three possible outcomes the data is sluggish and not granular, and it fails to pick up on slight changes in the regulatory environment.

These difficulties with data quality are not limited to civil society measures—many democracy-related indicators, including elections, judicial independence, and legislative activity, have spotty and inconsistent coverage over time and are not always reliable. A new project—the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem)—however, attempts to address these issues. V-Dem uses a sophisticated Bayesian measurement model to aggregate existing published data and opinions from more than 2,500 country experts to provide hundreds of robust democracy-related indicators and indexes. Most importantly, in contrast with the CSI, GCSI, public opinion surveys, and CIRI, V-Dem indicators are available for most countries from 1900–2014 and display variation over time. 

V-Dem includes many variables related to the regulatory legal environment for civil society, including measures of entry and exit regulations, repression, participatory environment, and the level of women's participation in associational life. Scholars associated with V-Dem used these indicators to generate a Core Civil Society Index (CCSI), which measures the strength of civil society in a country given (1) the organizational environment for civil society organizations and (2) the level of citizen activism [@BernhardTzelgovJung:2015]. 

Following this lead, I construct my own Civil Society Regulatory Environment (CSRE) index to measure only state constraints on civil society, ignoring citizen participation in associational life, based on the the CCSI's indicators for civil society organizational environment: (1) the level of state repression of civil society organizations and (2) the level of state control over civil society organization entry and exit into public life. The CCSI was constructed by aggregating several V-Dem variables using Bayesian factor analysis; for the sake of simplicity, my CSRE index uses only a simple sum of the relevant V-Dem indicators.

While V-Dem's unique combination of Bayesian modeling and detailed expert opinion makes the CSRE index arguably more robust and reliable than any single measure, it also means that the index is more difficult to interpret, as it is essentially a sum of scale-less vectors of model point estimates. [@fig:csre-top-bottom] provides some helpful context for understanding this index, showing the average environment index for the five highest and lowest countries from 2000–2014. The index has a range between roughly −6 and 6, with more repressive countries receiving lower scores—the average index score for autocracies is 0.3, while democracies average 3.7.

![Mean CSRE for five highest and lowest countries from 2000–2014](../../Output/figures/1-csre-top-bottom.pdf){#fig:csre-top-bottom}

Despite the CSRE index's methodological advances, it does not necessarily reflect the regulatory environment for *international* NGOs. There is unfortunately no systematic way to disentangle the application of the regulatory environment to domestic and international organizations, even though regulations apply unevenly to organizations depending on their home countries. Thus, following the statistical analysis in which I this more general measure of the civil society regulatory environment, I qualitatively examine how Russia has imposed specific legal restrictions on foreign NGOs and compare the conclusions of this case study with the statistical results.

## Key independent variables

### Autocracies vs. democracies

I use two different methods to distinguish between democracies and autocracies. First, I use data from the Polity IV project, which assigns democracy scores ranging from −10 to 10 [@MarshallJaggers:2014]. Regime type labels are then assigned based on this score: autocracies (−10 to −6), anocracies (−5 to 5), and democracies (6 to 10). However, while these categories of democratization are useful at large magnitudes (i.e. there is a clear difference between a country that scores a −8 on the Polity IV scale and one that scores a 6), marginal changes in democratization scores are often meaningless (i.e. a change from a level 5 anocracy to a level 6 democracy is rather imperceptible and more susceptible to rater subjectivity). The Unified Democracy Score (UDS) scale was created in 2010 to address the uncertainty inherent in measuring democratization [@PemsteinMeserveMelton:2010]. This innovative scale uses Bayesian estimation and simulation to generate aggregate democracy scores based on 10 other standard measurement scales (including Polity IV). Instead of assigning each country a single score, the UDS provides every country-year with a posterior score distribution, including a mean and a median score, a standard deviation, and 95% confidence intervals. UDS scores range from −2 to 2, with more democratic nations receiving higher scores. For this working paper, I only use the mean point estimates in my analysis, but in the future I will use UDS scores in Monte Carlo simulations to capture more uncertainty in regime type classification. 

![Civil society regulatory environment index across range of regime types](../../Output/figures/1-regime-csre.pdf){#fig:regime-csre}

For the sake of analytic simplicity, I use a cutoff point of zero in both polity and UDS to roughly classify countries as democracies and autocracies. As [@fig:regime-csre] shows, In both cases, the CSRE is quite correlated with regime type (r ≈ 0.8)—very few countries below the zero-based threshold have highly restrictive civil society regulations.

### Internal regime stability

As explained above, I hypothesize that regime stability and competitiveness predict restrictions on civil society. I measure stability in multiple ways. First, I use data from Political Risk Services' International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) to measure the internal risk and stability of a regime [@Political-Risk-Services:2014]. ICRG provides a monthly political risk rating for 143 countries based on a weighted collection of indicators, including government stability, corruption, ethnic tensions, and conflict.[^10] Risk ratings range from 0–100, with the most stable and least risky countries receiving the highest scores, and the most unstable countries ranking around 30–40. As I am interested in *internal* regime stability, I omit the subcomponent of the score measuring external conflict, and to avoid issues with collinearity, I omit the subcomponent measuring democratic accountability, since I use other indicators of democracy, explained below. Having removed these subcomponents, I rescale the risk score to have a maximum of 100 to generate a final internal political risk index.

![Changes in ICRG internal political risk index over time](../../Output/figures/1-icrg-examples.pdf){#fig:icrg-examples}

To demonstrate how shifts in internal stability and political risk are actually represented, [@fig:icrg-examples] shows the ICRG internal political risk index for three countries: Norway and Congo, which have seen the least amount of change since 2000 (though with extreme values of risk), and Syria, which has seen the most amount of change in the same time period. In the 10 years prior to the Syrian war, the country dropped 10 points in its risk score, representative of a slow deterioration and stagnation of internal stability, and from 2010–2014, the country dropped nearly 20 points to its current highly volatile and risky status. Few countries have seen such dramatic and precipitous drops in risk ratings—in general, the average difference between minimum and maximum internal risk score from 2000–2014 was 19.8 in democracies and 22.7 in autocracies. Globally, democracies tend to be more stable than autocracies ([@fig:icrg-regime]), and the difference between average risk ratings for each regime type is statistically significant, but there is substantial variation across countries.

![Mean internal political risk over time, group by regime type](../../Output/figures/1-icrg-regime.pdf){#fig:icrg-regime}

Beyond aggregate regime risk and stability, I include several variables directly related to domestic political institutions. I measure how many consecutive years the executive has been in office with data from the World Bank's Database of Political Institutions [@BeckClarkeGroff:2001], which indicates the longevity of the regime. I also include measures of regime competitiveness (as authoritarian regimes are ostensibly less competitive). First, using data from the National Elections Across Democracy and Autocracy (NELDA) project [@HydeMarinov:2012], I calculate the number of years that have passed since a country held a competitive election. Following @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a, I consider an election competitive if opposition parties were allowed to participate, if more than one political party was legal, and if the ballot provided voters with a choice of candidates. Second, I count the vote share won by the largest opposition party, as measured by the Database of Political Institutions [@BeckClarkeGroff:2001].

![Civil society regulatory environment index across various measures of regime stability](../../Output/figures/1-auth-vars.pdf){#fig:auth-vars}

[@fig:auth-vars] shows that each of these institutional variables is moderately correlated to the CSRE (r ≈ ±0.5). The left panel shows that while few regimes have had rulers in place for longer than 10 years, those with long-tenured executives tend to have stricter civil society regulatory environments. Following my theory, countries that have higher ICRG stability scores and executives with long tenure should be more likely to impose restrictions on the regulatory environment for civil society. The central panel shows that most countries—even those that impose severe restrictions on civil society activities—tend to not let too many years pass between competitive elections, likely indicative of the emergence and strength of competitive authoritarianism. Even the most restrictive regimes allow for some (limited) competition. Finally, the panel on the right demonstrates that countries with more restrictions on civil society tend to have very low opposition victory rates, while countries with fewer restrictions have much more variability in vote shares. In theory, countries that allow more time to lapse between competitive elections and have less successful opposition parties will enact stricter restrictions on civil society.

### Stability of neighboring countries

I also hypothesize that external stability affects civil society restrictions within states. That is, when a regime observes coups, revolutions, wars, uprisings, and general instability in nearby countries, it will crack down on associational life and increase restrictions on civil society. I measure external stability in two ways.[^11] First, for each country, I include the lowest ICRG internal political risk score from all other countries sharing borders, under the assumption that a regime will be influenced by events in the riskiest nearby country.[^12] I also include the average internal political risk for each country in the country's  geographical region[^13] and subregion[^14] to capture regional instability beyond a state's neighbors. Both of these external risk variables are correlated to a country's internal CSRE (see [@fig:ext-risk-vars])—civil society appears less restricted in countries located in more stable neighborhoods. Because neighbor and (sub)regional stability are closely correlated (r = 0.68), I do not include them together in any models. 

![Civil society regulatory environment index across various measures of regime stability](../../Output/figures/1-ext-risk-vars.pdf){#fig:ext-risk-vars}

Beyond neighboring and regional internal instability, actual destabilizing events likely influence a regime's decision making and survival strategy. Coups d'etat, in particular, represent the worst case scenario for executives working to stay in power. To this extent, I count all successful and unsuccessful coups in a state's neighboring countries, subregion, and region [@PowellThyne:2011]. In general, coup activity in both neighboring countries and subregion are associated with a more restrictive regulatory environment for civil society (see [@fig:ext-coup-vars]).

![Civil society regulatory environment index across various measures of regime stability](../../Output/figures/1-ext-coup-vars.pdf){#fig:ext-coup-vars}

### International shaming

Finally, I argue that less threatening pressures from abroad (i.e. not coups and not revolutions) can also influence a state's civil society regulatory environment. As discussed previously, diplomatic pressure from states and international NGOs can induce countries to improve and reform policies, particular in regards to human rights. Government officials often care about their reputations and adjust their behavior accordingly. Previous research has defined and measured international shaming in various ways, including the release of INGO press releases, US State Department reports, and X. 

In an attempt to capture the broadest possible definition of international shaming, I use event data methods to construct new measures of diplomatic and NGO conflictual engagement with a given state. Event data uses computational natural language text algorithms to parse a text and determine *who* did *what* to *whom* *where* and *when*. After feeding millions of news media stories into this algorithm, the resulting data identifies the main actors, actions, and locations in a story, and can be used to track civil wars, popular protests, and even instances where INGOs target governments through shaming campaigns. In addition to *counting* events, the *nature* of the events is also determined algorithmically and coded along a −10 to 10 point scale (also called Goldstein scores) measuring how conflictual or cooperative the event is—the higher a score is in absolute value, the more intensely conflictual or cooperative it is.

I use event data from DARPA's Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS),[^15] which provides more than 14 million events from 1995 to 2016. I include only events where the target actor (the "to whom") is a state and where the source actor (the "who") is either a state (for measures of diplomatic shaming) or an international NGO (for measures of global civil society-based shaming), resulting in 4.6 million interstate and 7,000 state-INGO interactions. I then aggregate these daily events by country and year and create two standardized measures to represent the level and intensity of international and INGO-based shaming towards a country in a given year: (1) the percent of all events in a country-year that are conflictual, and (2) the average Goldstein score of all conflictual events in a country-year (as the absolute value, so that events with higher numbers are more conflictual). These two measures capture different aspects of international shaming. For example, nearly 60% of all interstate activity in Iraq in 2003 were conflictual, with an average Goldstein score of roughly 7, likely due to the start of the US-led invasion. However, many countries have seen more severe conflict, but less often—only 16% of events in Azerbaijan in 2009 were conflictual, but with an average severity of 9.2.

![Average proporition and intensity of conflictual events](../../Output/figures/1-events-both.pdf){#fig:events-both}

[@fig:events-both] shows the average proportion and intensity of interstate and INGO-state interactions in the ICEWS database. In general, a greater proportion of INGO-state events are conflictual, likely because INGOs are more likely to engage with a state to condemn regime action (also, there are far more interstate events, meaning that the average proportion of conflictual events is dampened). However, interstate conflictual events tend to be more intense, arguably because states have more powerful tools for coercing states (i.e. militaries), while INGOs are limited to reports and press releases. Notably, there is no statistically significant difference in conflictual proportion or intensity in autocracies or democracies.

## Control variables

I also control for a variety of domestic and international factors that could also influence a regime's decision to restrict civil society. Domestically, I control for a regime's propensity to violate the physical integrity rights of its citizens using data from the CIRI project. Governments that use torture, extrajudicial killing, disappearance, and other violent tactics are likely to restrict associational life. I also control for each country's GDP per capita (in constant 2005 dollars) and population, both measured by the World Bank [@WDI:2015]. I log both variables to account for their exponential distribution.

Internationally, I check to see how embedded regimes are in the global community. Following @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a, I include the amount of development aid to determine the regime's dependency on foreign donors. I also include a count of the number people who are members or volunteers in international NGOs with branch offices in that country, following @Murdie:2014, using data from the Yearbook of International Organizations. More INGO involvement in a regime could mitigate the government's attempts at restricting civil society. Finally, I include the KOF Index of Globalization [@DreherGastonMartens:2008] to measure the regime's economic, social, and political embeddedness. 

## Modeling decisions

I estimate a series of frequentist ordinary least squares (OLS) models.[^16] Each model is actually estimated twice—once for autocracies (Polity IV score \< 0) and once for democracies (Polity IV score \> 0)—to capture the interaction of regime type on all variables. The dependent variable in every model leads all covariates by one year to capture the lagged effect of all dependent variables. While this is admittedly a rough and naive identification strategy, these models are ultimately meant to demonstrate the conjoint determinants of the civil society regulatory environment and not the ultimate causal impact or treatment effect.
