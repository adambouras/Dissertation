# Magic diffs

`latexdiff` has the cool ability to produce beautiful diffed output from two LaTeX files. It does not work well with files that use includes, thoughâ€”it works best with flattened, standalone TeX files.

Here's how to generate a diffed PDF based on a previous version of the dissertation (like the one I submitted to my committee for the defense, or https://github.com/andrewheiss/Dissertation/commit/2a0650901f4a88319fab8e1dca2e3ede4999cc8b):

- Go back in time in the repo: `git checkout 2a0650901f4a88319fab8e1dca2e3ede4999cc8b`
- Generate the TeX file and PDF: `cd Writing && make duke`
- Flatten the TeX file: `latexpand --makeatletter dissertation.tex > dissertation_orig.tex`
- Move `dissertation_orig.tex` somewhere temporary
- Go back to HEAD of git repo: `git checkout master`
- Generate the TeX file and PDF of the current version: `make duke`
- Flatten the current TeX file: `latexpand --makeatletter dissertation.tex > dissertation_flat.tex`
- Move the original `dissertation_orig.tex` back to the main writing directory
- Compare the two versions: `latexdiff dissertation_orig.tex dissertation_flat.tex > dissertation_diff.tex`
- Build the new diffed version: `latexmk -xelatex -quiet dissertation_diff.tex`
- Voila!
