Thanks so much for your fantastic feedback and comments during my dissertation defense! I have made the following changes to this (hopefully final) version of the dissertation, addressing each person's core critiques and concerns.

---- 

## Timur: Definition of institutions / equilibrium

Timur noted that I was using two different definitions of institutions, looking at them both as (1) the Ostrom-esque "rules of the game" and (2) Knight and Platteau's view that institutions are equilibria. I removed the "rules of the game" definition and rewrote the description of institutions in chapter 1 to be more explicit about the idea of institutions as equilibria. In the future book manuscript version of this project, I will be even more explicit about framing the institutional dynamics of amicable contempt as a change in equilibrium, which will also address Tana and Tim's point about dynamism, which I address below.


## Judith: Flexibility / tautology

In her comments on my original manuscript—and in in-person discussions prior to the defense—Judith noted that the idea of organizational instrumental flexibility is almost tautological and attempts to carry too much of the theory. In particular, the manuscript conflated instrumental/resource-based flexibility, programmatic flexibility, and normative flexibility all together. That is, even if an NGO has tons of money (like Index on Censorship), they won't necessarily engage in programming that fits with regime desires, but will instead stay out of the country due to their organizational norms.

To address this, I redefined "instrumental flexibility" as "programmatic flexibility," which decouples programming decisions and adaptations from instrumental issues like organization size and revenue. These instrumental concerns influence programming decisions, but they do not determine them completely—organizational norms (still represented by the ideal point) are also linked to programming decisions. I clarify this in chapter 4.


## Tim: Is the global crackdown on NGOs consequential or not?

Tim had a question about whether the global crackdown on NGOs is consequential, since in the introduction I say that it's bad for NGOs, but that NGOs are working around it, thus implying that it's not bad, and contradicting the idea that these laws *are* consequential. I clarify this point in chapter 1, emphasizing the costs that these regulations impose on NGOs. In the original manuscript, I had painted a far too rosy picture, stating "But these new regulations have not ended global civil society, nor will they." I have toned that language down and qualified it, stating that many NGOs are unable to successfully adapt. The manuscript should now show that the global crackdown does matter.


## Judith: Theoretical contributions and future research sections

I added these sections.


## Judith: Causal claims? Is this theory building?

Judith noted that I turned to causal claims too easily, even though the dissertation is an exercise in theory building (and indeed, the small-*n* strategy recommended by the nested analysis approach is to engage in theory building instead of model testing). I deemphasized causal claims throughout the manuscript and included a brief discussion in the new theoretical contributions section in the conclusion reminding the reader that the findings here serve to build and develop (and not test) a theory of INGO-dictator relations.


## Tana: Clarifying puzzle since so few countries really completely exclude

Tana noted an inconsistency in my framing puzzle—though INGOs pose a potential danger to regime stability, very few countries completely exclude them. Instead, different types of authoritarian regimes attempt different strategies of neutralizing their threats. Totalitarian North Korea, for instance, *does* exclude nearly all foreign organizations, while monarchical Saudi Arabia floods the NGO sector with GONGOS operated by the country's hundreds of princes and princesses to limit the market available for INGO advocacy. 

I address this point by making the puzzle less absolute in chapter 1. Instead of stating that authoritarian regimes are surprising everyone by continuing to allow INGOs to work in their countries, I explain that most countries allow for some level of civil society advocacy and that one tool dictators use to limit and control INGO activities is regulation.


## Judith: Quantitative analysis of exit, pending size

Judith wondered if the survey showed larger organizations were more likely to exit than smaller organizations. I added Figure 4.3 showing the proportion of organizations reporting a variety of reactions, including exit, changing issues, and shifts in hiring patterns. In general I find that organizations with more than 6 staff members (the median number of employees) are more likely to undertake each of these adaptations, bolstering the idea that staff size (and, by proxy, other instrumental factors) enhances programmatic flexibility.


## Tana: Dynamism

Both Tana and Tim noted that my model of amicable contempt is more dynamic than I have currently presented it. For instance, there is a possible temporal element to the model, since past experiences with NGOs likely influence regimes' decisions to regulate NGOs. Similarly, there are interaction effects between hypotheses—domestic instability influences international civil society regulations differently depending on the length of time a dictator has been in power. I added a paragraph to chapter 1 describing this dynamism and explaining that, for the sake of simplicity, this dissertation keeps the model parsimonious and simple. In the book that I will write based on this dissertation, I will address dynamism more directly in both the statistical models (with interaction terms) and in the case studies.


## Tim: Explain response rate, statistical

The original manuscript had a methods appendix with some background details about how the survey was conducted and how the response rate was calculated. Tim wanted more details about the survey, including how I invited and recruited organizations. I expanded the survey methods appendix to include these details and also included the wording of the invitation. I include the original survey instrument in the appendix and I make the hyperlink to the static online version more prominent in the appendix text. I also included a long footnote explaining how the participation rate was calculated, since it uses a special formula rather than just dividing the number of respondents by the number of potential respondents.


## Timur: Controlling NGOs in other countries by encouraging other countries to control their NGOs

Timur raised a fascinating point about an interesting possible strategy for regulating NGOs—a country might encourage their peers and neighbors to regulate the INGOs within *their* borders as a strategy for mitigating the threat of INGOs in its own country. Given that previous research has found that INGOs tend to flock to countries with the friendliest regulations in a region, more recalcitrant countries may encourage their peers to impose harsher regulations on INGOs in an effort to deny these organizations a regional safe haven. Article 19 did this. I am unaware if larger, more powerful countries like Egypt, China, or Russia have worked to convince their neighbors to tighten controls on INGOs, but future research is needed. 

There is also a possibility of regional influence in the opposite direction, with countries purposely adopting laws similar to those passed in their more powerful neighbors. For instance, since the passage of the 2012 and 2015 anti-NGO laws in Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan have passed similar regulations, modeled in part on Russia's original legislation. Similarly, in 2017 Jordan began applying its anti-terror laws to civil society organizations, following Egypt's lead. Authoritarian learning and diffusion may lie beneath the phenomenon of the global crackdown on civil society, as regimes notice, copy, and adapt the regulatory strategies of their peers.

I added both of these points to the future research section of the conclusion.


## Judith: Clearer on method of inference for case studies

I neglected to explain my method of inference in both the INGO and the country case studies. I added an explanation of the scaffolding for both sets of case studies at the end of chapters 3 and 4.


## Judith: Miscellaneous edits

I made dozens of smaller edits that Judith had suggested prior to the defense, including ensuring consistency in the bibliography (i.e. all internet-based citations have an access date), and the reorganization of some sections for clarity. 

I also clarified the language around the selection of Egypt, China, and Russia as cases. In the original manuscript, I had made it sound like the statistical model magically just happened to choose those three countries, which was clearly not the case. In this version, I removed language that implied the case selection was so fortuitous and explicitly state that the selection was not random, but that it fits well with the nested analysis approach.
