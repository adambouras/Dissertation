Examples of big INGOs leaving

- Carter Center in Egypt
- CIHRS in Egypt
- Group of INGOs in Egypt in 2012/13 (Ray LaHood's son)
- OSF in Russia
- Even smaller ones like AMERA international
- China foreign NGO law
- Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, etc.
- Reports from eCivicus and regular Guardian column - [https://monitor.civicus.org/FAQs/](https://monitor.civicus.org/FAQs/)
- Not even just restrictive authoritarian countries—Canada and Israel have also passed laws restricting foreign funds and foreign NGOs. 
- Plus, who knows what Trump will even do 

It seems from all of this that the space for global civil society is shrinking—it may be that my whole dissertation will be obsolete in the future with no more INGOs! :)

Growing concern over closing space for civil society, domestic NGOs, and international NGOs.

During his second term, President Obama took up the cause of closing civic space:

> This growing crackdown on civil society is a campaign to undermine the very idea of democracy. What is needed is an even stronger campaign to defend democracy." Obama, Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting, 2014-09-23[https://livestream.com/accounts/376536/events/3361201/videos/62944615](https://livestream.com/accounts/376536/events/3361201/videos/62944615); see [http://www.icnl.org/news/2014/23-Sept.html](http://www.icnl.org/news/2014/23-Sept.html)too

Not just the US. The UN is concerned with it ([https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/38409/en/unhrc-32:-free-expression-violations-a-global-concern](https://www.article19.org/resources.php/resource/38409/en/unhrc-32:-free-expression-violations-a-global-concern)), as are other countries, and other big INGOs like Amnesty, HRW, Oxfam, etc.

Space is indeed closing, but INGOs are adapting. Work continues in creative ways:

- OSF
- AMERA handing off reigns
- CIHRS working from Tunisia
- Lifting Hands International
- Venezuela LDS project

INGOs adapt. Governments adapt in turn, passing new laws and regulations and renegotiating the relationship between the two parties.

This raises important questions. Why are authoritarian countries closing off space for associational life? What's making them restrict civil society? 

Beyond all this, why do we care? What are the bigger questions here? From IR side, questions of sovereignty, international institutions, exposure to transnational actors, etc. From public policy/affairs side, INGO behavior and strategy


---- 

Autocrats see global civil society as a strategic player in their domestic political landscape. International NGOs can help autocrats maintain regime stability and remain in power by providing services and expertise, bestowing a sheen of international legitimacy and reputation, and offset domestic institutional challenges—sometimes as a scapegoat. At the same time, though, INGOs pose a risk to autocrats. Their missions and goals might conflict with the regime—for instance, a human rights INGO might condemn a leader who relies on torture to control dissidents. To address this dilemma, autocrats use specific and careful strategies for enjoying the political, social, and other practical benefits of INGOs while simultaneously offsetting the costs and risks of letting these organizations operate in their country. One of their primary methods for controlling INGOs is through regulation and restriction.

International NGOs understand this contentious relationship with their host countries and work to adjust and adapt to the political environment. Parallel to the cost-benefit calculus of their host governments, INGOs seek to balance their need to pursue their work (often in opposition to the regime) against the risk of acting as a political pawn of the regime and propping it up. Rather than passively accepting the regulatory environment imposed on them, INGOs work to either shape that environment or adjust their programs and strategies to maintain access to the country.

Anti-NGO regulations are increasing worldwide and the space for civic space and associational life is contracting. But these new regulations have not ended global civil society, nor will they—autocrats will continue to benefit from NGOs, and NGOs will continue to adjust creatively to remain attractive and active. In this complicated state of amicable contempt, with both parties reacting and adjusting, who wins? When can regimes reap the benefits of INGO programming? What determines whether an INGO can avoid co-optation *and* remain actively engaged in a country? How do INGOs adapt? And how does this adaptation affect their strategies? Does it fundamentally change the organizations themselves, and can autocrats keep the upper hand?

# Dictators and activists: Reluctant bedfellows

Today, nearly 30 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union, early optimism for a global "third wave" of democratization—the rapid transition of the world's last remaining autocracies to liberal democracy—appears quite quixotic. Although most authoritarian regimes hold democratic elections [@LevitskyWay:2010], allow for multiparty legislatures [@Blaydes:2011], empower an independent judiciary [@GinsburgMoustafa:2008], or use independent central banks to set monetary policy [@Boylan:2001], authoritarianism remains durable. Instead of democratizing, dictatorships don "democratic garb" [@Brownlee:2007, 25] and delegate authority to other domestic institutions in part to maintain their own power, offsetting domestic pressure and boosting their international reputation [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. 

Little research, however, has attempted to explain authoritarian treatment of domestic and transnational civil society through a similar institutional lens. By viewing civil society as yet another institutional actor that autocrats have to balance, we can begin to answer crucial questions. Why do self-interested autocrats allow INGOs to operate in their borders? What determines how autocrats regulate civil society in their borders? How are INGOs influenced by pressures from authoritarian regimes they work with?


## Authoritarian institutional balancing

Dictators are rarely omnipotent or invulnerable. Autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010], a phenomenon I term *institutional balancing* (see @fig:balancing). This theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that autocrats are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism is best viewed as a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other pseudo democratic institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

![Example of an authoritarian regime balancing multiple domestic and international institutional actors](../../Graphics/balancing.pdf){#fig:balancing}

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can establish narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage, or create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to create popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this dissonance creates an interesting (and potentially destabilizing) dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014]. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

`TODO`: More on standard political institutions like elections, etc.; transition to civil society as an institution

## Civil society as a political institution

The idea of a civil society has long been salient in political science, with commentators as early as De Tocqueville theorizing on the importance of groups of citizens that actively engage with their governments to advocate for reform, rights, change, and other services. Civil society is traditionally defined as "an agglomeration of private, voluntary organizations that have the capacity to assert the rights of individuals and groups," [@Cook:2007, 143] and is most commonly operationalized as non-governmental organizations (NGOs),[^1] or organizations that operate outside of both the private and public sectors, ostensibly filling social gaps left by firms and governments [@AhmedPotter:2006, 30; see also @Hansmann:1980]. Civil society need not be explicitly political or rights-focused—any sort of association, including bowling clubs and parent/teacher associations, allows citizens to come in contact with each other, build social capital, and aggregate individual preferences [@Putnam:1994].

Given this wide range of possible civil society organizations, ranging from neighborhood book clubs to international human rights advocacy NGOs, a variety of theoretical approaches to civil society have emerged, including `X` and `Y`. However, these approaches miss important elements regarding the relationship between civil society organizations and the regimes they work in. I argue that we can gain significant analytic and theoretical insight into the purpose and functions of civil society within a regime by looking at civil society through an institutionalist lens. While formal institutional theory has typically been applied to more traditional institutions such as constitutions, electoral systems, legislative committee assignments, or judiciary structures, these theories can be usefully applied to non-traditional political phenomena like civil society. In particular, institutional theory allows us to see how civil society as an institution lowers transaction costs and promotes coordinated collective action against or in support of the state. Regimes must contend with, balance out, and adapt to these organizations in order to survive. Additionally, we can observe how political institutions shape the behavior of civil society organizations. TODO: Finish this

Simply put, institutions are the collection of rules that define the parameters of social activity, or the "humanly devised constraints that shape human interactions" [@North:1990, 3]. These "rules of the game" dictate who can make decisions, which actions are allowed or prohibited, and how obedience is rewarded and disobedience punished [@Ostrom:1990, 51]. Institutions can range from formal structures like constitutions and property ownership regimes to informal social and cultural norms, practices, and traditions. Ultimately, institutions—both formal and informal—gain traction in society because they reduce the transaction costs of social and economic interaction. When players interact, they can trust that their counterparts will behave appropriately because of the rules of the underlying institutional framework.[^2] 

Treating civil society as an institution yields the greatest theoretical advantage when considering how civil society organizations and NGOs lower transaction costs by solving difficult collective action problems and public goods dilemmas. Civil society has typically been defined in one of two ways.[^3] The first school of thought, championed by @Putnam:1994, holds that vibrant associational life forges links that cross social boundaries—bowling clubs, parent/teacher associations, neighborhood groups, volunteer organizations, and other nonprofit groups tend to include members from multiple social strata, thereby breaking down vertical social boundaries and increasing social trust. This associational life increases civic engagement, embeds norms of reciprocity into society, and helps improve democratic governance—in other words, civil society ultimately *strengthens and bolsters* the state.[^4]

Others have argued that civil society should stand *in opposition to* the state. The deeper social connections formed by participating in associational life can allow members of these organizations to "stand up to city hall" [@Jamal:2007, 4], to pursue their community self-interests, or to help maintain moral order and social norms. In this view, civil society organizations act as watchdogs against the government (or private sector), providing members of society with a focal point for popular mobilization. While discussing the institutional foundation for public morality—norms that shape the preferences and payoffs for players in a society—Platteau argues:

> A civil society helps to back trust whenever there is a sufficient number of citizens who feel vengeful enough to work towards exposing publicly the illegal acts or malpractices of both private and state agents, and towards bringing enough pressure to sanction them even though such actions entail significant costs to themselves (by denouncing economic crimes they produce a public good) [@Platteau:2000, 308].

The fact that the denouncement of grievances is a public good is key to civil society's role as a social focal point. @Ostrom:1990 convincingly argues that social norms (defined as institutions) allow communities to police and regulate common-pool resources—rival but non-excludable goods that behave similar to more traditional public goods. To prevent overfishing, communities of Turkish fishermen developed detailed social norms to dictate where fishing is permissible on which days by which fishermen. Without those norms, an aggrieved fisherman whose area on a lake is depleted by a rival has no recourse; with these norms, the fisherman has recourse to social shaming, stigma, and compensation. Similarly, a single aggrieved citizen alone cannot directly challenge the state or a firm with much efficacy. However, institutional structures allow them to address those grievances, thus providing a public good of engagement with the state. 

@Weingast:1997 provides a more general explanation of how institutions can provide this public good, arguing that institutions prevent rulers from infringing on the rights of their citizens by organizing a "coordinated understanding" of the violation of those rights and allowing citizens to more easily coordinate and respond to potential abuses. That is, when citizens face government abuse, they face a coordination dilemma—they must convince other citizens to band with them to seek redress against the government, which is often difficult. Institutions solve this coordination dilemma in two ways: (1) institutions such as constitutions, legal structures, and civil society provide mechanisms that allow citizens to initially seek redress (e.g. an aggrieved citizen has a constitutional right to sue the government; nonprofit organizations are legally allowed to provide community services the government may be unable to deliver, etc.), and (2) those institutions generate a coordinated understanding—or the expectation that something must and shall be done to address government abuses—among a nation's citizens [@Weingast:1997, 262]. Non-aggrieved citizens assist those who are victims of government abuse because (1) there are institutions in place that allow for redress, and (2) the citizens who are not victims expect that the current victims will come to their aid in the future. Because of this ability to rally popular support for collective action, civil society can be seen as a critical watchdog against government and private sector abuses and thereby protect citizens against the state.

It is more useful, however, to move beyond the normative debates over these two extremes of civil society skepticism (that it serves only to build the state) and civil society utopianism (that it serves only to protect against the state) and instead treat civil society as simply an institutional vehicle for coordinating collective action. A key implication of this argument is that the relationship between institutions within a state is rarely unidirectional—any political institution can either act independently or be acted upon by other institutions, such as the ruling regime, legislature, or private sector. As an institution, civil society can exert influence on a regime, pressuring and shaming it to follow specific norms. Conversely, civil society can also be directed, co-opted, or controlled by the state to help ensure a regime's survival. 

# International NGOs: yet another actor to be balanced

Authoritarian institutional balancing is not limited solely to domestic institutions. States today confront a complex stew of domestic and international issues and actors, where activists, bureaucrats, legislators, judges, firms, civil society organizations, international organizations, media organizations, and foreign states interact and influence domestic policy and behavior [@Linos:2013; @Slaughter:2004]. Similar to their domestic counterparts, international NGOs can provide particularly acute pressure against authoritarian regimes, especially as they work in concert with domestic NGOs to pressure and shame states that behave poorly. Domestic NGOs that are restricted or blocked by their government will turn to allies in the international NGO community, who will in turn lobby their home states to convince international organizations like the UN to put high-level pressure on the offending regime, thereby creating an opening for the original domestic civil society organizations to advocate for policy changes. This relocation of advocacy power follows a boomerang pattern, moving from domestic NGOs to INGOs to foreign states and international organizations to domestic NGOs again [@Keck:1998]. 

With repeated boomerang-like pressure from domestic NGOs and INGOs, responses to individual issues can evolve into human rights norms, resulting in the institutionalization of new policies and practices within an offending state. @RisseSikkink:1999 describe this process of norm socialization as a spiral, or a sequence of repeated boomerang effects. Domestic actors repeatedly turn to INGOs and transnational networks for help in their advocacy and slowly wear down the state. Initially the state denies the accusations of repression and claims that foreign human rights norms are invalid, but with repeated domestic and international pressure, the regime will begin to make concessions to the human rights network. Continued pressure helps formalize these concessions into actual legislation, and as politicians adhere to these policies (again because of domestic and international boomerang effects), they internalize the human rights norms that underpin the policies, thus resulting in long-lasting reform.

Relying on non-state actors as part of stability-seeking institutional balancing is fraught with risk—INGOs are wildcards in authoritarian regimes [@DeMars:2005]. INGOs have real effects on domestic politics and policies and pose significant risks to the regimes that allow them to operate. Previous research has found that countries receiving negative evaluations in human rights INGO reports and press releases see a marked reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows [@BarryClayFlynn:2013] and tend to respond with better compliance to international human rights norms [@Murdie:2012]. Close networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can even marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012].

![Percent of dictatorships that allow domestic and international institutions](../../Output/figures/ingos_dictatorships.pdf){#fig:ingos-dictatorships}

In spite of the risks of dealing with INGOs, authoritarians are increasingly opening up their countries to INGO advocacy and services. @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a show that in general, institutionalization in authoritarian regimes has increased over the past century, as dictatorships permit pseudo-democratic electoral institutions, such as party politics and competitive elections. In @fig:ingos-dictatorships I replicate their work and add a fourth measure of institutionalization: the percentage of dictatorships have at least 50 active development, environmental, health, and human rights INGOs, shown in orange.[^5] As seen in the figure, international associational life has also grown more active in more of the world's authoritarian regimes since 1990. `TODO`: Get updated data

## Controlling civic space to curtail INGO influence

Though associational life has increased, regimes have worked to control its expansion, often through formal and informal restrictions on INGO activity. Ongoing research on the human trafficking advocacy sector demonstrates the pervasiveness of anti-NGO restrictions. 

`TODO`: Supplement this Judith stuff with results from my survey 

In a survey conducted in 2014, 522 human trafficking NGOs answered questions about their work in 132 different countries. One hundred twenty-four NGOs (23.8%) reported feeling either somewhat or very restricted by the governments of 66 of those countries (see @fig:restrictions-map).[^6] 

![Government restrictions reported by human trafficking NGOs](../../Graphics/restrictions_map){#fig:restrictions-map}

The nature of these restrictions varied, ranging from strict legal requirements to general government antagonism or apathy toward INGO programming. For example, one INGO working in Southeast Asia reported "[a]ll work must be approved and done in direct concert with government counterparts. [Our] presence in country [is] controlled and evaluated by government officials, even those who are not familiar with our work," while another stated that "we had to be certified and continue to submit to monthly reporting, mandatory financial audits, site visits, social welfare approval, government regulations regarding our aftercare property, work permits for all foreign volunteers, annual reporting and additional certifications." Some NGOs responded that informal restrictions, such as corruption and inefficiency in the police and government bureaucracy, also limit the programming these organizations can do in-country. Finally, organizations working in democracies like Canada, Australia, or France, reported feeling restricted because of tax code limitations on charitable advocacy, similar to the political advocacy limitations the US imposes on 501(c)(3) charities.

One interesting theme in the responses of these human trafficking NGOs is that many noted that government restrictions are calibrated to help the regime. This is best summarized by the previously cited Southeast Asian INGO, which expressed that "[a]ll of our work is seen through the lens of … party priorities." Sovereign nations engage with international organizations and transnational civil society selectively, depending on rational calculations of how that engagement might be beneficial to the regime. Authoritarian regimes in particular tend to follow international norms and allow INGO operations only when doing so "allows the regime to (1) shore up its authority and legitimacy and to (2) deflect international pressures" [@Hawkins:1997, 407–8, *numbers added*]. Autocrats can use INGOs and other non-state actors to stabilize and reinforce their political power at home. For example, because competition for foreign patronage created an absence of strong links between Russian advocacy groups and the public, the Russian state has been able to restructure the civil society sector so that only NGOs that "work on issues that align with the national interest" receive funding and support [@Henderson:2010, 254], short-circuiting international "spiral" pressure and silencing domestic advocacy movements. 

Authoritarian regimes will also use INGOs and other non-state actors to improve their international reputations. @Kelley:2012 argues that because election monitoring has become a global norm, governments—even those who fully intend on cheating and manipulating the election—permit election monitoring INGOs as a way of appearing credible and democratic to peer nations. To ensure that monitoring efforts do indeed improve the regime's reputation, authoritarian governments will try to circumvent international monitors or purposely invite friendly (or bribable) monitors to counterbalance more objective organizations. Because of this, election monitors can ultimately "contribute to the false legitimization of governments" [@Kelley:2012, 155]. 

These rational strategies have the potential to backfire, however, since authoritarians are rarely able to fully control all rival actors. Though inviting election monitors does provide substantial reputational benefits, the presence of high-quality monitors makes it more difficult to cheat and is associated with better election quality, fewer violations of electoral law, and more incumbent turnover [@Kelley:2012, 124]—rulers in competitive authoritarian regimes can lose monitored elections. In post-revolutionary Egypt, international human rights monitoring organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have benefitted from increased operational latitude as the different regimes have sought to bolster their international reputation. With this greater flexibility, these organizations have been able to issue dozens of reports condemning the government for its human rights abuses. Increased transnational oversight into Egyptian human rights has led to increased international shaming and condemnation.

## What influences INGO behavior?

`TODO`: Transition from authoritarian and civil society institutions to INGO behavior

INGOs have long been treated as a "black box" in much of the existing academic work on international institutions, and have often been assumed to act as altruistic bulwarks against the state, filling policy and issue gaps in the international system, and run by managers with only the best intentions [@Corry:2010; @Skjelsbaek:1971; @NyeKeohane:1971; @Bartelson:2006]. In the past decade, however, scholars have worked to move beyond this simplistic view and uncover the determinants and effects of INGO behavior, treating transnational actors as both normative and strategic [@Cooley:2002; @Keck:1999; @Kelley:2009a].@PrakashGugerty:2010a helped formalize this newer trend, arguing that advocacy INGOs should be seen as firms working in policy markets, driven by normative and instrumental concerns, and motivated organizational survival and growth. Later, @MitchellSchmitz:2014 simplified this argument, showing that INGOs must balance their normative principles against the instrumental need of organizational survival. Unlike states or firms that generally face singular goals, like maximizing national security or maximizing profits, INGOs face a tradeoff between mission and money and must pursue both simultaneously—they must "instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" [-@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 489]. Seen in this more nuanced light, it is clear that, like firms, INGOs are subject to interagency conflicts, face issues with accountability, compete for scarce resources, and struggle to get their issues on the global agenda. In previous work with Johnson [-@HeissJohnson:2016], I provide a useful typology for this newer body of work (summarized in @fig:ISR-pyramid), which organizes these emerging structural determinants of INGO behavior into three related and interlocking categories: (1) the internal structure of the INGO, (2) the external dynamics and relationships faced by the INGO, and (3) the institutional context that defines the boundaries of INGO action. 

![A unified framework for analyzing INGO behavior [@HeissJohnson:2016]](../../Graphics/ISR-pyramid){#fig:ISR-pyramid}

## Internal traits

A significant portion of INGO behavior is shaped by the preferences and ideals of its managers, employees, and volunteers, who in turn shape the organization's stated mission, vision, and values. For example, an organization's managerial structure can influence the success of its programming. @Wong:2012 shows that INGOs can centralize or decentralize different forms of managerial power: the power to propose new goals and missions, the power to enforce those goals, and the power to actually implement those proposals. Organizations that successfully centralize proposal power while decentralizing implementation power are better able to pursue a central agenda without stifling local creativity, thus leading to better success [@Wong:2012].

## Interactions with other actors

INGOs do not operate in isolation—even if an organization perfectly balances and refines its internal managerial structure, it still must interact with third-party actors as it pursues its policy agenda. An INGO's interactions with these other external actors shape its behavior. Early work on opening the INGO black box focused on many of these external factors. For example, @Cooley:2002 argues that competition among INGOs actually leads to perverse outcomes and sectoral insecurity, as organizations will often undermine their competitors, withhold information, act unilaterally, and seek government rents. Additionally, @Bob:2002 shows that INGOs compete in a "harsh, Darwinian marketplace where legions of desperate groups vie for scarce attention, sympathy, and money" [@Bob:2002, 37]. Organizations that are experts at emotive marketing, employ native English speakers, use charismatic spokespeople, and craft their messages to fit Western sensibilities are far more effective in the global community than their competitors. 

The relationships that form as organizations interact also have a direct impact on INGO power and influence. @Carpenter:2014 demonstrates the importance of the shape and nature of INGO networks. INGOs are most able to push new normative ideas onto the global agenda if they are connected to key nodes—or gatekeepers—in a network, who then vet the proposals and give (or deny) them credibility and legitimacy. In general, the more connected or centralized an INGO is in relation to other organizations, the more influential it will be. @Murdie:2014 provides additional evidence of the power of INGO networks, finding that human rights INGOs that network and collaborate together increase their advocacy output. The nature of these network relationships influences the quality of this work, though—as more organizations free ride and rely on larger, more prominent INGOs, advocacy output decreases.

## Institutional environment

Beyond the influence of internal and external actors, INGOs are also shaped by more elusive actors—the political structures and institutions they interact with [@HeissJohnson:2016; @GugertyPrakash:2010; @BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. INGOs are products of the legal regulations, historical precedents, political trends, and cultural norms of both their home countries and they countries they target, all help define the boundaries for INGO operations. 

In contrast with internal NGO traits and interactions with other actors, the effect of the institutional environment on international NGOs is relatively understudied [@BloodgoodTremblay-BoirePrakash:2014]. @Stroup:2012 shows that the organizational structures and missions of INGOs are deeply tied to the cultural and legal environments of their home countries. For example, she argues that CARE USA's mission reflects American norms of efficiency and results-oriented pragmatism by using a professional staff, securing large amounts of government funding, and avoiding anti-American advocacy. In contrast, Amnesty International, based in the United Kingdom, eschews many of the stricter norms of business-like efficiency and professionalization to focus more on advocacy work. Additionally, because Amnesty International refuses government funding (in part because of the historical absence of government funding for charities), it focuses much of its advocacy work on British and American human rights abuses. 

Emerging research on domestic nonprofit organizations in the United States can inform future research into INGO behavior, revealing how NGOs both (1) are adversely affected by the rules, regulations, and institutional structures governing NGO activities, and (2) manipulate those structures for their own benefit and organizational survival.

First, institutional rules and norms can create inefficiencies in nonprofit programming. For instance, NGOs often change their behavior to obtain external government funding. Government grants (both domestic and foreign) limit the flexibility of nonprofits by imposing strict reporting requirements that can shift these organizations' missions [@Suarez:2011], and by crowding out private donations [@KimVan-Ryzin:2014]. Government grant requirements often insist that applicant organizations pursue specific behaviors, such as collaboration with other organizations, even if collaboration is not the optimal strategy for the organization. In fact, because of this push for collaboration, regardless of its consequences, one of the best predictors of a nonprofit organization receiving government funding is whether or not it collaborates with other nonprofits [@Suarez:2008; @Suarez:2011]. As these organizations create inefficient collaborative networks, organizational objectives and missions are often dropped or discarded in pursuit of additional funding, resulting in a market failure [@WitesmanHeiss:2016]. These inefficiencies are directly tied to the structural incentives to collaborate, pushing organizations to adopt suboptimal strategies in the interest of securing funding. Foreign NGOs suffer similar inefficiencies and crowding out effects [@GugertyKremer:2008], but work remains for research on international NGOs.

Second, rather than shift and adjust their organizational missions and values to fit the legal environment, many American nonprofits maneuver *within* that environment and find workarounds for their preferred strategies. That is, nonprofits in the United States generally do not change their missions—they change their legal and organizational structures to make their missions happen.[^7] In the United States, nonprofits typically incorporate initially as 501(c)(3) organizations. While this designation provides significant tax benefits (i.e. full tax exemption), IRS regulations restrict some of the activities and income generation strategies these organizations can pursue. In order to become more politically engaged, nonprofits will often create a 501(c)(4) or (c)(6) subsidiary, which offers fewer tax benefits but allows for direct political advocacy. Similarly, IRS regulations impose an operational test on nonprofits' business activities. If an organization generates significant unrelated business income (UBI) it can fail this test and lose its exempt status. To prevent this from happening, 501(c)(3)s will often spin off a for-profit subsidiary that feeds its income into the main organization [@Daniel:2014; @SloanGrizzleKim:2015]. Ultimately, US nonprofits learn to deftly maneuver the legal regulatory environment to maximize their revenue and carry out their preferred programs.[^8] 

International NGOs working in dictatorships likely also try to bend the legal environment of the countries they work in, but are more limited in their influence on the domestic politics. 

`TODO`: Incorporate Maya Wang quote and finish this paragraph… 

> To work around restrictions NGOs can work on less sensitive topics, with friendly government officials, partner with local organisations and try to funding sources that aren't considered "sensitive". All of that is being done very creatively by many on the ground. But, we have to ask ourselves whether doing so might compromise one's original intentions. Helping the government maintain the status quo in some ways undermines long-term prospects, as ultimately civil society does need a free press, a democratic government and freedom of association.

Pushing the envelope with organizational and legal innovations in these countries also carries significant risk—if an INGO gets too creative in spinning off subsidiaries or partnering with domestic NGOs, the regime or ruling party can expel it.


# Amicable contempt: International NGOs and authoritarian regimes

`TODO`: Connect this theory section with the previous section

International and transnational NGOs do not operate in a vacuum. As described previously, INGOs are influenced by a host of factors beyond their stated mission vision, values, and strategies. In addition to these well established behavioral determinants, the regulatory environment for foreign-based advocacy and service provision in autocratic nations plays a critical role in shaping the behavior of international NGOs that work in those countries. 

An INGO's mission and menu of programs will often conflict with the preferences of the regime. Accordingly, an organization must decide how to adapt its programming to fit the requirements and needs of its host country. This decision can be difficult, pitting conflicting organizational values against each other. If the organization is too antagonistic, contentious, or principled, it runs the risk of expulsion, potentially leaving the INGO unable to continue its work in the country. However if the organization is too cooperative, its selection of programs may not be credible or effective as the NGO kowtows to the dictator's demands.

I use an adaptation of negotiation theory [@Raiffa:1982; @Mayer:2010] to conceptualize this dynamic relationship between dictators and INGOs.[^10] I model the interaction between authoritarian regimes and INGOs in any given issue area (human rights, development, advocacy, etc.) in simple two-dimensional policy space (see @fig:winsets). Each actor has a preference for a certain level of advocacy or service provision, marked as solid circles in the figure (Regime~ideal~ and INGO~ideal~). Regimes set and implement *de jure* policies to prevent INGO programming from going beyond their ideal point (the reserve value or "best alternative to a negotiated agreement" (BATNA) in negotiation theoretic terms), while INGOs will engage in programming that (when possible) fits within the bounds set by the regime. In addition to these ideal points, each actor has a range of flexibility in the implementation of their regulations or programming, shown in the horizontal lines flanking the ideal points (negotiation space in negotiation theory terms). The space where the two preference ranges overlap (the zone of possible agreement (ZOPA) in negotiation theory) determines both the regime's *de facto* level of restrictions and the INGO's actual mix of programming in that country. 

![Programming preferences in two-dimensional policy space](../../Graphics/winsets.pdf){#fig:winsets}

An authoritarian regime's INGO regulatory environment comprises two components: (1) formal *de jure* legislation and policies (represented by the ideal point) and (2) *de facto* implementation of those policies (represented by the negotiation space around the ideal point). Regimes will establish a regulatory environment for international civil society that falls along a continuum of restrictiveness, ranging from *tolerance*, or very few legal or actual restrictions on INGO programs, to *expulsion*, or a complete ban of all INGO activities. The larger the ZOPA, the more tolerant the regime will be about international NGOs working in their regimes, and vice versa—when there is no overlap, an INGO will face expulsion.

In turn, and analogous to the regime's regulatory environment, an INGO's response to authoritarian restrictions comprises three components: (1) the organization's normative principles and ideals, represented by the ideal point, (2) the organization's instrumental flexibility in actually implementing those principles, represented by the space around the ideal point, and (3) the alignment of an INGOs programming with regime preferences, represented by the distance between the two parties' ideal points. Parallel to the regime's initial imposition of the regulatory environment, NGOs will respond along a continuum of cooperation, ranging from *compliance*, or tolerance and cooperation with the legal limits imposed by the regime, to *antagonism*, or blatantly and openly resisting those restrictions. INGOs that engage in programming close to the authoritarian regime's preferences will be more compliant with the regulatory environment, while organizations that pursue more contentious programming will be more antagonistic.

![Possible authoritarian regulatory environments and corresponding INGO responses](../../Graphics/working_theory.pdf){#fig:working-theory}

The relationship between INGOs and authoritarian regimes is dynamic, as ideal points shift along the spectrum and negotiation spaces expand or contract. @fig:working-theory demonstrates a mix of possible regulatory environments and INGO responses. The Carnegie Moscow Center is an excellent example of compliance and tolerance. In response to the 2012 and 2015 anti-INGO laws, the Center shifted its ideal preferences, "sacrificing its intellectual independence and analytical rigor," to realign itself more closely with the regime and maintain its presence in the country [@Kirchick:2015]. OSF, on the other hand, is an example of antagonism and expulsion. Rather than soften its stance toward the regime or shift its resources to other less contentious programs within the country, OSF withdrew and has remained a vocal critic of the regime. 

INGOs can also be antagonistic in a tolerant environment. For example, tight networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while some INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012]. Likewise, INGOs can be compliant in an expulsive environment. Though China is currently in the midst of an unprecedented expansion of civil society and has cooperated with dozens of international NGOs, the regime has shuttered several small INGOs that work with seemingly innocuous issues like advocacy for disabled people [@Chin:2015].

# Hypotheses and testable implications

`TODO`: Update all these; this whole section is older stuff

## Authoritarian regimes

As described previously, the nature of authoritarian institutional meddling takes on many different forms and is done with different purposes. For example, dictators will co-opt legislatures to dole out the benefits of regime patronage to the elites and allow for better, more reliable monitoring of elite loyalty [@Blaydes:2011]; capture or co-opt domestic civil society organizations to enhance service provision and citizen monitoring; or tacitly permit controlled popular protests to give citizens an outlet to vent their dissatisfaction with the government [@Chen:2012] or signal state intentions during international negotiations [@Weiss:2013]. Each of these pseudo-democratic domestic institutions (elections, civil society, state-sanctioned popular protests) enhance regime stability. I contend that, just as they do with other domestic actors and institutions, dictators must carefully balance and contend with international NGOs. 

Key to harnessing this institutional dissonance for stability, however, is the autocrat's ability to manage and control these external actors. When dealing with domestic challengers and institutions, dictators have a wide array of policy choices to manipulate and control their influence, ranging from formal legislation against certain activities to imprisoning and torturing recalcitrant legislators, judges, or activists. Autocrats have a more limited menu of policy options for controlling international actors, however, because of their nationality. While it maybe be easy to harass and imprison the family of a native activist, attempts to jail or torture international advocates or aid workers are far more risky, as foreigners often have the legal and political backing of their home states. Though there are a handful of instances of authoritarian regimes attempting to formally prosecute foreigners (e.g. in 2013 an Egyptian court convicted 16 American NGO workers, and the government continues to detain reporters and cameramen from the Al Jazeera news network), dictators generally only have one type of policy lever to control INGOs: increasing or decreasing legal restrictions related to INGO advocacy and service provision.

I thus argue that the restrictiveness of an autocrat's regulatory environment for international NGOs is directly related to the regime's need for stability, resulting in my first hypothesis: 

> **H~1~**: When authoritarian regimes perceive themselves to be more stable, the *de jure* and *de facto* regulatory environment for international NGOs will be less restrictive (and vice versa—more unstable regimes will have more restrictive INGO regulations).

That is, when it is stable, an authoritarian regime's ideal point and negation space will shift towards the right, providing more openings for INGO activity. Conversely, instability causes a leftward shift and constricts potential INGO activity.

This hypothesis leads to two testable implications:

* Formal *de jure* legislation regulating international civil society will be passed during times of instability.
* The *de facto* application of the regulatory environment will be more restrictive and harsh during times of instability.

I will argue that there are at least three observable and measurable sources of stability:

1. *Domestic tensions*: factors that threaten a regime's domestic stability, including the threat of competitive elections, relations between ethnic groups, opposition organizations gaining power relative to the regime, etc.
2. *International reputation*: regimes often care about how they are perceived by major world powers and the international community[^11]—a good international reputation can imply or display domestic stability.[^12]
3. *Fear of contagion*: events in neighboring countries (such as the threat of revolution) can influence the stability of a regime—dictators will react to the instability of their neighbors to maintain their own domestic stability.

The internal dynamics of an authoritarian regime define much of the regime's response to and attitude towards international NGOs. However, the nature of the organizations that work in the country also influences the regime's INGO policies. In particular, regimes will adjust the *de facto* INGO regulatory environment based on the advocacy or services INGOs provide:

> **H~2~**: When the issue area an INGO works with is more aligned with the preferences and needs of a regime, the *de facto* implementation of the regulatory environment for INGOs will be less restrictive (and vice versa—organizations working with more contentious issues will face stricter INGO applied regulations).

That is, the regime's negotiation space will expand rightwards toward INGOs that pursue programming aligned with the regime's needs and will shift away from INGOs that engage in programming that more contentious.

This hypothesis implies that the *de facto* application of INGO legal restrictions will vary by the issue areas different INGOs pursue and the needs of the regime. For example, a regime that actively seeks out education INGOs in an effort to improve local education programming will be less restrictive with those organizations, while simultaneously acting more harshly against freedom of expression INGOs that advocate against the regime.

Both of these hypotheses are admittedly broad and generic. At first blush it seems obvious that unstable regimes will restrict INGO activity when it conflicts with their interests, while more stable regimes will strategically embrace INGO activity when it is advantageous to do so. However, the empirical application of these hypotheses is more nuanced, as a regime's preferences for INGO services can enhance or decrease regime stability. For example, regimes can loosen up restrictions on international advocacy during times of instability—such as allowing international election monitors to observe contested elections [@Kelley:2012]—in an effort to improve stability. Similarly, regimes can impose harsher restrictions on INGOs during times of political stability—though China is currently in the midst of an unprecedented expansion of civil society and has cooperated with dozens of international NGOs, the regime has shuttered several small INGOs that work with seemingly innocuous issues like advocacy for disabled people [@Chin:2015]. These simple counterfactuals indicate that there is a sort of tipping point in the cost-benefit calculus for restricting INGOs. When will fewer restrictions lead to more regime stability, and conversely, when will a stable regime impose harsher restrictions?

Recent game theoretic research has attempted to address this question of the optimization of repression, finding that China permits or disallows anti-government investigative reporting based on the government's current attitude to corruption and the current threat of revolution [@Lorentzen:2014], with equilibria that dynamically shift depending on the structure of a regime's payoffs. I will argue that a regime's optimization of INGO restrictions will follow a similar pattern. Though H~1~ and H~2~ are stated simply, the different components of stability and regime preferences will interact dynamically—for example, increased domestic instability might influence a regime's desire to enhance international reputation, leading to a strategic decision to decrease INGO restrictions.

## International NGOs

International and transnational NGOs do not operate in a vacuum. As described previously, INGOs are influenced by a host of factors beyond their stated mission vision, values, and strategies. In addition to these well established behavioral determinants, I argue that the regulatory environment for foreign-based advocacy and service provision in autocratic nations plays a significant role in shaping the behavior of international NGOs that work in those countries. 

An INGO's mission and menu of programs will often conflict with the preferences of the regime—for example, a freedom of expression INGO will likely pursue advocacy that is antagonistic towards Chinese speech, censorship, and media policy. Accordingly, an organization must decide how to adapt its programming to fit the requirements and needs of its host country. This decision can be difficult, pitting conflicting organizational values against each other. If the organization is too antagonistic or contentious, it runs the risk of expulsion, potentially leaving the INGO unable to continue its work in the country. However, if the organization is too cooperative, its selection of programs may not be credible or effective as the NGO kowtows to the dictator's demands. 

The degree to which an INGO is cooperative or antagonistic is most easily seen through its selection of programming, or the advocacy and services the organizations attempt to implement within the authoritarian country. The decision to antagonize or cooperate with the regime (and, in turn, adjust its programming) is largely a function of (1) the existing regulatory environment, (2) an INGO's original ideal preferences for programming, or its normative principles, and (3) how much power and flexibility an INGO has in relation to the regime. 

Both ideology and flexibility work in concert to explain the selection of (and changes in) an INGO's menu of programming. INGOs are driven primarily by their objective ideological principles (i.e. adherence to an overarching mission or vision statement), but are also constrained by the realities of implementation [@MitchellSchmitz:2014]. Temporarily disregarding flexibility, it is clear that an organization with an ideal point outside of the regime's established regulatory environment will need to change its strategy to continue its operations within the authoritarian nation. This pressure to change programs leads to the following hypothesis: 

> **H~3~**: Holding flexibility constant, an international NGO with ideal preferences that fall outside the allowable regulatory environment will face pressure to temper its programming  and become more compliant to regime demands (and vice versa—organizations with preferences that fall within the regulatory environment will maximize the contentiousness of their advocacy or service provision). 

An INGO can resist this pressure to comply, however, by increasing its operational flexibility, or its negotiation space. I define flexibility as the INGO's ability to protect and expand its menu of programming, maximizing the organization's overlap with the regime's preferences (or the ZOPA) while maintaining the organization's normative ideal point. If an INGO is able to marshal resources, work with more partner organizations, request the support of powerful external actors, or pursue other strategies to circumvent, mitigate, or otherwise reduce the impact of government regulations on their total menu of programming, the negotiation space will expand and the regulatory environment will be less restrictive. My final hypothesis encapsulates this dynamic:

> **H~4~**: When an international NGO has more operational flexibility in its provision of services or advocacy, the organization's overlap with regime preferences will increase and the INGO will face fewer restrictions (and vice versa—organizations with less flexibility will face harsher restrictions).

I will argue that there are several observable and measurable forms of operational flexibility, each with different effects on an INGO's response to regime regulations:

1. *Programming flexibility*: an INGO that offers a diversity of programming in a country (or in neighboring countries) can shuffle resources between those programs, while an INGO that pursues a single program in a county will be more threatened by harsh regulations.[^13]
2. *Network flexibility*: an INGO that is linked to more powerful nodes in an issue area network can use those connections to increase its flexibility, while an INGO that is more isolated will have less external support against a restrictive legal environment. This external support network includes other INGOs working on similar issue areas (e.g. an INGO that partners with a prominent organization like Reporters without Borders or Amnesty International will have enhanced flexibility by nature of those relationships) or foreign foundations and government agencies (e.g. an education INGO with formal support from USAID or DFID will have more protection against restrictions).
3. *Flexibility in application of regulations*:^[This form of flexibility, while important, is the most difficult to systematically measure.] an INGO has the ability to circumvent or ignore regulations and exploit legal loopholes (e.g. an organization might be able to open a local branch under a different name, the government might be unable to enforce strict registration requirements, or a local executive director may have personal connections with mid-level bureaucrats who turn a blind eye to some programming). 

In some cases, the empirical implications of these hypotheses are obvious, as seen in the corner cases of @fig:working-theory. Organizations with maximum flexibility and that correspondingly face no restrictions will naturally be able to behave according to their ideal preferences and will either (1) cooperate with the government when the space between regime and INGO ideal points is small, as in the case of Chinese consultative authoritarianism [@Teets:2014], or, (2) as in weak states like Haiti and Afghanistan, when the space between regime and INGO ideal points is large, antagonize the government at will and operate beyond its regulations. Conversely, organizations with no flexibility will naturally face the harshest restrictions and will either (1) be kicked out in spite of the benefits they offer the regime, even if the space between regime and ideal points is small, as in the case of China's ongoing shuttering of innocuous INGOs, or (2) if the space between regime and INGO ideal points is large, be forced to antagonize the regime from abroad, as with Human Rights Watch and the Carter Center, which are both currently barred from Egypt. 

The link between restrictions and flexibility is clearest (and most interesting) when applied to organizations that are in tension with the regime and that face smaller, more dynamic overlapping preferences  (the center column highlighted in grey in @fig:working-theory). In this environment, organizations with lower levels of flexibility will struggle to maneuver and circumvent regime regulations, often leading to unwanted cooperation with the regime. For example, if a hypothetical INGO that teaches new media skills to state-employed reporters wants to teach skills that promote independent antagonistic reporting, but is unable to because it is unable to mitigate or challenge existing INGO regulations, it will necessarily cooperate with the regime and shift its preferences leftward. If that INGO had more flexibility, however, such as formal backing from the State Department, or other in-country programs it could shift its attention to, its ZOPA with regime preferences would increase and it would be less inclined to change its programming.
