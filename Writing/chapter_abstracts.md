# Abstracts for each chapter

Since I'm in this weird space of writing a book with separate article-like papers, sometimes the chapters need abstracts, and sometimes they don't. This is the central repository of abstracts.


## How to include in YAML

These should go in the YAML front matter when they need to be included. Because they're so long it's best to use YAML's [folded style syntax for strings](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21699210/120898) (`>`, or `>-` to chomp the final newline):

~~~yaml
abstract: >-
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet…
~~~

The string needs to be indented by some number of spaces (2, 4, whatever.). If the abstract is more than one paragraph, subsequent paragraphs need to be indented by some number of spaces, otherwise they'll be concatenated into the previous paragraph:

~~~yaml
abstract: >-
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet…

    Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident…
~~~


## Chapter 1: Introduction and theory

Over the past decade, international NGOs (INGOs) have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes as they respond to emergencies, assist with development, or advocate for human rights. Though these services and advocacy can challenge the legitimacy and power of the regime, many autocratic states permit INGO activities and INGOs continue to work in these countries despite the sometimes heavy restrictions on their activities. In my dissertation, I theorize that this relationship between INGOs and autocrats creates a state of amicable contempt, where each party is aware that the other threatens—yet sustains—their existence. Autocrats and INGOs engage in a dance of cost-benefit calculus, each trying to advance their own agenda without upsetting their counterpart. Regimes work to set the optimal level of INGO regulations, maximizing the practical and reputational benefits that INGOs provide and minimizing the potential destabilizing costs of INGO activities. Meanwhile, INGOs work to find the optimal mix of programming within a country that allows them to pursue their principled objectives within the boundaries the regime has set—affecting as much change and providing as many services as possible without risking expulsion from the country.  


## Chapter 2: Authoritarian Institutions and Restrictions on International Civil Society

In this chapter I use Bayesian statistical analysis with a cross-sectional dataset of 97 autocracies to explore the determinants of authoritarian civil society restrictions, testing the effect of a regime's concerns of internal stability, external stability, and international reputation on its civil society regulatory environment. I find that this environment constricts the longer an autocrat stays in power and in response to violent protests in the region. Importantly, however, there are conditions under which autocrats make concessions to INGOs—when autocracies become more politically stable and allow opposition parties to be more involved in domestic politics, and when regimes witness coups, nonviolent protests, and other forms of political instability in neighboring countries, the regulatory environment for civil society can expand.

## Chapter 4: The Effect of Target-Country Restrictions and Authoritarian Politics on International NGO Programming

Research on international NGOs has demonstrated that these organizations are strategic actors that are susceptible to a host of internal and external influences, including the global demand for their advocated issue, their internal managerial structure, or the institutional environments of the countries they are based in. However, little research has looked at the effect of host country politics on INGO behavior. How do international NGOs adjust their programming in response to the regulatory environment and domestic politics of the countries they target while simultaneously exerting pressure and influence on the politics of those countries?

In this chapter, I argue that the political, legal, and regulatory institutions of the countries that INGOs target and work in have a substantial influence on these organizations’ strategies and programming. I present an original theoretical model to explain and predict how INGOs respond to regulations and restrictions, given an organization’s core principles, its instrumental concerns, and its power relative to the regime. I test this argument by analyzing rich quantitative data, combining the results from a global survey of nearly 1,000 INGOs across a broad range of policy issues with more than a dozen interviews with INGO staff and volunteers. Ultimately, the findings from this chapter contribute to academic debates on authoritarian institutionalization and INGO behavior, deepening our understanding of the effects of political institutions on third-sector organizations. Additionally, the chapter helps INGOs operate more effectively in authoritarian contexts by demonstrating how INGO behavior shifts in response to changes in those regulations and providing guidance on how to mitigate these shifts.
