Education, low contention organizations don't tend to worry about this as much - scope condition = high contention
They're mostly focused on just doing their mission - priority isn't taking on government, it's helping people

# Encouraging shifts in INGO missions through program capture

TODO: A couple paragraphs outlining:

- Theoretical form of regulation (see capture part of @fig:regulation-purpose-theory): Host governments constrict the civil society regulatory environment in an effort to target INGO missions and capture the benefits from their work or coerce INGO missions to be more amenable to regime preferences
- Effects on INGOs: Laws lock INGOs into their programs, change their missions; make them pawns in greater political game within country
- Expected INGO reactions: When relationship is not contentious and/or when flexibility is limited, organizations will be more likely to align their missions with the government and explicitly shape their programs to match government objectives. When relationship is more contentious, organizations will act more strategically to protect against changes: choosing regulatory body, using more/fewer local/foreign staff, moving to a different country
- Organizations with most resources and flexibility are best able to deal with changes



## Why capture programs?

Though fears of regime stability appear paramount in determining the relationship between INGOs and governments, the relationship between INGOs and their host governments is not always so antagonistic. Governments often take advantage of the foreign organizations working in their countries, using their presence and their services to boost their own public image at home and abroad. The presence of foreign organizations in failed states can signal growing stability and instill confidence in potential investors. For example, an education INGO working in East Africa reports:

> The [g]overnment is desperately seeking any form of cooperation with foreign countries to re-establish a resemblance of normality in a war-ravaged country that is slowly trying to lift off. Therefore any international action is warmly welcomed by top brass executives of any political side.[^1]

The presence of foreign NGOs can also act as a signal of compliance with international norms to domestic audiences. INGOs provide specialized services and expertise that are often not offered by domestic firms or local governments. Government ministries tend to partner with INGOs "whenever they need… services"[^2] to take advantage of improved services and to access better resources. One disaster relief INGO working in South Asia reports having a close and productive relationship with the government, since it "has recognized how quickly and efficiently our nonprofit was able to provide relief services and has supported partnerships with us in many areas related to our programs of health, education and [disaster] recovery."[^3] Government officials will also use foreign NGO services and expertise for personal political gain—a public health INGO working in West Africa notes that "some state officials want your services to be in their home villages and community"[^4] as a form of pork barrel politics, securing aid and services for their constituents, while an education INGO reports that the Latin American government they work with generally ignores them, except during elections, when "politicians will visit the partner we work with for photo ops."[^5]

TODO: Short ¶ outlining the rest of this section—governments attempt program capture with regulations related to oversight and operations.

## Resource capture: regulating funding and resources

Governments use legislation and regulations to control INGO funding. Resource-focused restrictions are as common as restrictions on registration—only a third of responding organizations report not feeling any effects of resource-related laws (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping)


 again with the intent of limiting the political influence of outside actors in domestic politics. . By regulating and limiting access to funds, governments are able to directly target a crucial element of instrumental flexibility. Regulations aimed at funding and other resources at first appear to be more related to gatekeeping, since prohibiting certain types of funds can limit access to the country. However, most resource-related restrictions also permit the government to reap monetary benefits from guest INGOs, and such extractions can challenge core organizational values.

For instance, governments can directly capture resources by imposing additional taxes and fees for INGO activities or by demanding bribes for continued access. 

How? Forcing INGOs to pay additional taxes, bribes for access

one INGO working in the Caribbean reports that "every regulation or law gives a potential pretext for an official or policeman to attempt to solicit a bribe"[^6]



- Payroll taxes and health insurance



The second method for limiting resources has become more prominent than levying additional social security taxes or requiring local bribes. Since the late 2000s, many countries have passed laws severely limiting or banning funding from foreign donors

This emphasis on foreign funding laws is warranted—as discussed above, registration laws can be benign and do not necessarily adversely affect INGOs, and restrictions on assembly and speech target a specific subset of advocacy- and politics-oriented INGOs that non contentious NGOs. Foreign funding laws, on the other hand, explicitly limit foreign influence on domestic activities and cause direct harm to all international NGOs, which are internationally funded by definition. The ongoing global crackdown on civil society gained prominence in response to harsh anti-NGO laws that specifically targeted foreign funding and connections, such as TODO Russia, China, and Egypt. 




NGOs don't like it + additional fees and taxes can enrich the governments INGOs are advocating against



Find ways around registration
Other INGOs find other bureaucratic loopholes. Stymied by a complicated registration process, an organization working in Eastern Africa gave up and began funding local NGOs instead of opening an official office in the country. 







## Managerial capture: regulating oversight

Governments are can be closely—and sometimes directly—involved in INGO programming, particularly in authoritarian contexts. The left panel of @fig:freq-both shows that organizations working in both types of regimes tend to be in fairly regular contact with the government, with the majority of INGOs meeting with officials at some level of government at least once a year. This diverges from how often INGOs claim to be required to submit formal reports to the government in the right panel of @fig:freq-both. The majority of organizations working in democracies—roughly 40% of all respondents—do not have any official reporting requirements, while a little over 15% of organizations working in democracies are required to report annually. In contrast, organizations that target autocracies are far less likely to not need to report, generally must check in at least annually with the government, and are more likely to need to report more than once a year. Autocracies thus have a heavier hand in INGO affairs, requiring more formal reporting and oversight than their democratic counterparts.

![Frequency of contact with government and formal reporting to government](../../Output/figures/3-freq-both){#fig:freq-both}

In addition to demanding oversight through reporting, one common method states use to manage international NGOs is to position government officials within the governance structures of these organizations. The case study on China in the previous chapter described how the Chinese government now requires that all international NGOs have a formal sponsor from the Communist Party. Many responding organizations report similar arrangements in their countries. In Eastern Europe, an MP who chairs the education committee personally monitors the educational programming of one INGO,[^7] a foreign affairs minister works directly with an education INGO in South America,[^8] and the former president of a European nation is a member of and consults for a human rights INGO, representing the diplomatic interests of their country through the NGO's programming.[^9] It is unclear what the consequences of going against government preferences when officials are so closely involved in INGO decisions—few respondents with bureaucrats and politicians in their organizations opted to describe what might happen. However, a human rights INGO working in East Africa explained that officials "could close down the project" if government demands are not met.[^10]

Regulations can give bureaucrats final say in INGO programming even without formal participation in governance. An advocacy organization working in West Africa must have its work checked and approved by the government and its programs are sometimes vetoed and "over powered,"[^11] while other organizations are required to get final ministry-level approval for their activities, programs, and publications.[^12] In other cases, regulations dictate that INGO programming falls under the direct supervision and control of local governments, leaving organizations with little flexibility in how they operate, essentially turning them into arms of the government—an organization working in West Africa had several of its programmatic themes subsumed by the government,[^13] with bureaucrats determining which activities the NGO should handle.  

Notably, however, having bureaucrats involved in organizational decision making  does not always disadvantage INGOs. @Teets:2014 has shown that INGOs working in China systematically shop for the optimal oversight agency, work carefully to build positive relationships with their local officials, and seek to provide tangible benefits for their government sponsors by providing needed services and offering crucial expertise. INGO respondents confirm this finding, with many describing their efforts to cultivate relationships with politicians and bureaucrats. A human rights INGO working in Western Africa learned that the current and former ministers of justice were both personally opposed to the death penalty. The organization built rapport with the ministry and provided information, tools, and advice to the ministers to help them work toward national abolition of the death penalty. These close connections have subsequently helped the INGO obtain legal status in the country—in 2016, one of the INGO's local partner organizations faced a noticeably smooth registration process because of its work with the government.[^14] Other INGOs pursue similar strategies, inviting government staff, officials, police, and judges to serve in advisory positions on specific projects and programs and encouraging bureaucrats to participate in stakeholder meetings, with the explicit goal of increasing their influence and standing with key decision makers.[^15] Thus, when they enjoy sufficient flexibility, INGOs can harness and shape direct government involvement in their favor, pushing back against—and even reversing—regime attempts to shift or tame organizational missions and ideals.

TODO: Reactions to oversight, based on flexibility + contentiousness


## Program capture: regulating operations

The legal environment dictates more than just the registration requirements for INGOs. Laws regarding NGO operations give governments control over some aspects of their advocacy and programming. This control is sometimes accidental and indirect. For instance, an orphanage working in Central Asia reports regularly getting locked into programs because of bureaucratic inefficiency. Their host country requires that all international NGOs dealing with orphans fully fund all children for a full calendar year. However, their donor sponsorship funds are collected irregularly and can sometimes disappear, leading to difficult financial decisions:

> We are not allowed by the … government to withdraw the names of orphans sponsored until the end of each year even if we did not receive funding for that orphan but we still must pay for that orphan until the end of each year.[^16]

This regulation puts substantial strain on the organization's resources and allows the government to force the orphanage to dip into its general fund to guarantee its services. Other respondents report similar instances where host governments use bureaucratic delays and rules to lock INGOs into their programs.[^17] This indirect form of control allows the government to guarantee access to INGO services regardless of donor cash flow, but imposes significant financial burdens on those INGOs.

Government involvement can also be more overt. Rules can give bureaucrats final say in INGO programming. An advocacy organization working in West Africa must have its work checked and approved by the government and its programs are sometimes vetoed and "over powered,"[^18] while other organizations are required to get final ministry-level approval for their activities, programs, and publications.[^19] In other cases, regulations dictate that INGO programming falls under the direct supervision and control of local governments, leaving organizations with little flexibility in how they operate, essentially turning them into arms of the government—an organization working in West Africa had several of its programmatic themes subsumed by the government,[^20] with bureaucrats determining which activities the NGO should handle.

Reactions to operations, based on flexibility + contentiousness

Coerced changes in programs because of government regulations are quite rare.
