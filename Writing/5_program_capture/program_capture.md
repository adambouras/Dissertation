Gatekeeping regulations provide repressive governments with tools to filter out unwanted international NGOs and reduce the effectiveness of the organizations they allow in their country. Rules that emphasize gatekeeping are defensive and allow regimes to balance and control the constellation of political institutions they face. Repressive governments are not limited to regulatory defense, though. Governments can take advantage of the foreign organizations working in their countries and use their services to boost their own public image at home and abroad. The presence of foreign organizations in failed states can signal growing stability and instill confidence in potential investors. For example, an education INGO working in East Africa reports:

> The [g]overnment is desperately seeking any form of cooperation with foreign countries to re-establish a resemblance of normality in a war-ravaged country that is slowly trying to lift off. Therefore any international action is warmly welcomed by top brass executives of any political side.[^1]

The presence of foreign NGOs can also act as a signal of compliance with international norms to domestic audiences. INGOs provide specialized services and expertise that are often not offered by domestic firms or local governments. Government ministries tend to partner with INGOs "whenever they need… services"[^2] to take advantage of improved services and to access better resources. One disaster relief INGO working in South Asia reports having a close and productive relationship with the government, since it "has recognized how quickly and efficiently our nonprofit was able to provide relief services and has supported partnerships with us in many areas related to our programs of health, education and [disaster] recovery."[^3] Finally, government officials will also use foreign NGO services and expertise for personal political gain—a public health INGO working in West Africa notes that "some state officials want your services to be in their home villages and community"[^4] as a form of pork barrel politics, securing aid and services for their constituents, while an education INGO reports that the Latin American government they work with generally ignores them, except during elections, when "politicians will visit the partner we work with for photo ops."[^5]

Governments can reap the benefits of international NGOs by employing regulations designed both to (1) capture the resources and programmatic outputs of INGO activities and (2) co-opt INGOs to act more amenably to regime preferences. In contrast with gatekeeping laws, regulations focused on program capture *are* designed to distort INGO missions, reducing the distance between the two parties' ideal points by nudging the INGO's core values closer to the government's preferences (see @fig:theory-regulation-purpose). Laws related to oversight and funding open the door for increased government control over INGO activities, potentially giving regime officials authority over organizational management and in-country budgets. INGOs can get locked into their programs and lose access to streams of foreign revenue. Additionally, governments can selectively use NGO regulations to generate public support for their regimes, either through positive public relations campaigns and photo opportunities, or by holding up INGOs as scapegoats and symbols of foreign intervention.

As with gatekeeping restrictions, the level of regulatory pressure from capture restrictions depends on the contentiousness of their relationship with the government. Low contention organizations generally fall within the regime's negotiation space and do not need to be induced to change—these kinds of organizations already provide the regime with direct benefits, offering aid, education, and other services the government needs. Since confronting government abuses and advocating for reform is not a priority for low contention organizations, these INGOs tend to not be as concerned with capture-focused regulations and instead focus on just carrying out their missions—many explicitly shape their programs to meet government needs to avoid regulatory burdens. INGOs involved in more contentious programs, though, must confront program capture restrictions. As with gatekeeping regulations, INGOs draw on their instrumental flexibility when responding to restrictions aimed at capturing their programs. However, there are subtle differences in how organizations rely on these resources. INGOs' primary goal when responding to registration laws is to maintain access to the country. Article 19 lobbied the Tunisian government to improve its civil society regulatory environment so it could safely remain, while AMERA worked for years to formally register and was hesitant to leave—exiting the country was its last option. Program capture restrictions elicit a different response. Instead of working to stay in the country, INGOs ensure that their missions are not compromised or co-opted. For organizations that can afford to do so, exiting the country and working from abroad to avoid resource, managerial, or public relations capture is a common response. Organizations with more resources are better able to resist changes to their missions and mitigate negative publicity.

In this chapter, I continue to draw on evidence from survey respondents to investigate the strategies INGOs use to resist capture and co-optation. I then explore two more international NGOs in greater depth: (1) Index on Censorship, a small magazine-*cum*-advocacy INGO that shames and lobbies against censorious governments from its headquarters in London, and (2) the International Republican Institute (IRI), a large democracy promotion INGO that monitors elections and advocates for political rights and civil liberties in more than 80 countries. I explore how these two INGOs move their programs in and out of target countries to protect their missions against government attempts to control their resources, capture their management, and use their advocacy as fuel in public relations campaigns.


# Nonprofit mission evolution and the importance of agency

Before looking at how governments work to capture INGO programs and how organizations respond and react to these attempts, a brief discussion of nonprofit mission evolution is helpful. Nonprofit missions can and should evolve in response to changes in the institutional environment, including revisions to government regulations, shifting donor preferences, and developments in stakeholder needs. Successful nonprofit strategy is "contingent on appropriate interpretation of environmental conditions and formulating an organizational response to address those conditions" [@Brown:2010, 207; @Mintzberg:1979; @Moore:2000]. To be effective, strategic evolution must take external trends and political developments into account [@Bryson:2010; @PoisterStreib:1999]. Importantly, changes in strategy should be purposeful and aligned with organizational values [@Scheimann:2009]. Survey respondents describe a variety of reasons for strategically shifting and refining their core missions over time. Organizations report that they "respond to issues in society,"[^6] "change [their] programming based on the needs and suggestions of the villagers"[^7] and "flex [their] priorities and reorganize in accordance with the immediate needs at the time they had arisen,"[^8] strategically changing their core missions to better align with the social environment and needs of their stakeholders. 

Others change their missions in response to shifting donor demands. Sometimes this involves a minor retooling of programs. For instance, organizations that previously received funding from large development IGOs like USAID, DFID, and UN agencies restructured their programs focused on accomplishing the UN's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to instead target the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that form the foundation of the UN's anti-poverty 2030 Agenda.[^9] Aligning with donor preferences can also require more substantial programmatic changes—one respondent laments, "I hope we evolve to meet changing needs, but, alas, we also evolve to meet changing donor priorities."[^10] Despite organizations' attempts to strategically respond to stakeholder needs, donor priorities are often more salient and receive higher priority, leading to mission drift [@Jones:2007]. 

Adapting to stakeholder and donor demands is not an insurmountable challenge, as both parties' preferences are generally aligned with INGO missions—though their priorities might shift, donors concerned with prosocial issues tend to remain focused on similar issues.  Additionally, ideally INGOs will voluntarily choose to respond to changes in their environments and maintain a degree of agency when designing their strategies. However, when working in repressive political contexts where government and INGO preferences are not aligned, conscientious strategic planning becomes more difficult and the threat of externally-imposed mission drift looms larger. Maintaining organizational agency and autonomy is more difficult, and changes in programming can be brought about involuntarily. Not only do authoritarian regulations serve to limit *access* to INGO target countries, as shown in the previous chapter, these laws are also designed to distort the *missions* of their guest INGOs and reshape them in the government's favor. In order to gain or maintain access to the country, INGOs can reshape their goals and missions to align better with their host governments' preferences: one highly contentious conflict resolution INGO working in Southeast Asia restructures its mission to maintain legal status in its host country, explaining that "[w]e have to comply with regustration regulations, and have to provide information / shape our programme to be able to be registered [sic]."[^11] Making these changes can conflict with INGO core values and result in a loss of control or agency over their strategies. Repressive governments are aware of this and can structure their regulatory environments in a way that allows them to co-opt or capture the programs of their foreign guests. Governments and INGOs thus find themselves in a state of amicable contempt, adding an extra dimension to the challenge of strategically adapting to the political environment.


# Resource capture: regulating funding and resources

First, governments use regulations to capture and control INGO funding. Resource-focused restrictions are as common as restrictions on registration—only a third of responding organizations report not feeling any effects of resource-related laws (see @fig:regs-faced-capture).[^12] By regulating and limiting access to funds, governments are able to directly target a crucial element of instrumental flexibility—a diversity of reliable revenue streams lends INGOs stability, and losing access to those streams can pressure organizations to become more aligned with government preferences. 

![Severity of program capture regulations, divided by contentiousness](../../Output/figures/5-regs-faced-capture){#fig:regs-faced-capture}

At first glance, regulations aimed at limiting funding and resources appear to be related to gatekeeping, since controlling revenue sources can reduce an organization's level of instrumental flexibility and can allow regimes to restrict INGO access to their countries. However, funding regulations are more likely to target organizational values and coerce changes in programming and strategy. In some cases, some respondents hesitantly reported that they had changed the issues they worked on and become friendlier with government demands in response to laws dealing with financial regulation and foreign donations.[^13] Much more commonly, though, government oversight over resources enables regimes to extract monetary benefits from guest INGOs and co-opt their activities for political gain. Attempts to co-opt or capture resources and revenue challenge core organizational values, and in response to these regulations, INGOs focus more on protecting their missions than on maintaining access to the country.

Governments can use regulations to directly capture resources by channelling money from INGOs into regime coffers. As one human rights organization in Central Africa notes, many restrictive states act as though "international [organizations] do not have the right to grant a certain amount of funds without passing through them,"[^14] and accordingly, states structure their regulatory environment in ways that encourage the capture of foreign money. According to survey respondents, strict laws related to resources—that notably need not be designed specifically with NGOs in mind—are the first step in a chain of events that allow restrictive governments to potentially seize resources and compromise organizational values. 

First, governments use both (1) indirect regulations such as import controls and payroll taxes, and (2) laws directly targeted at NGO funding sources as a method for imposing financial inefficiencies to slow down INGO activities and skim from their resources. These types of resource-related laws place pressure on low contention organizations that focus on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, since governments are better able to tap into the raw materials that these organizations deal with. For example, a humanitarian assistance INGO working in the Caribbean describes how import laws limiting foreign goods impose substantial obstacles on their activities, stating that it "[c]osts money while waiting for containers of goods to clear customs and the processing of our annual report that includes our Import List, which must be pre-approved annually taking months for approval delays our shipments and customs clearance even more."[^15] A development organization in East Africa faces similar laws restricting imports: "Imported resources are heavily taxed even though the resources are targeting vulnerable communities in the country. Rather than making things easier for such work, legal obstacles are put forth."[^16] Employment laws can also adversely affect international NGOs. One organization working in Latin America notes that government-mandated pay increases and changes in employee benefits for local staff "hurt us financially and results in the need to raise more funds while at the same time cutting costs in some areas,"[^17] while one working in the Caribbean explains that compulsory contributions to state social security and insurance schemes impose unnecessary costs and inefficiencies for their local employees.[^18] 

More prominent than these indirect types of resource-focused regulations, though, are laws limiting foreign funding for NGOs. Since the late 2000s, many countries have passed laws severely limiting or banning funding from foreign donors. This emphasis on foreign funding laws is warranted—as discussed above, registration laws can be benign and do not necessarily adversely affect INGOs, and restrictions on assembly and speech target a specific subset of advocacy- and politics-oriented INGOs that non-contentious NGOs. Foreign funding laws, on the other hand, explicitly limit foreign influence on domestic activities and cause direct harm to all international NGOs, which are internationally funded by definition. Perhaps more than any other factor, the international community's focus on a global crackdown on civil society gained prominence in response to laws that specifically targeted foreign funding and connections, including Russia's 2012 Foreign Agents law, China's 2017 Foreign NGO law, and Egypt's 2017 anti-NGO law. Foreign funding laws have an obvious gatekeeping function, and in previous chapters I showed that authoritarian regimes use them in concert with the de facto civil society regulatory environment to control which INGOs are allowed in the country. Organizations working in highly repressive regimes are often prohibited from contacting international organizations and can face "prosecution for receiving foreign aid and cooperation with international NGOs."[^19] Governments are also suspicious of foreign funding "in part because they know terror groups receive funding this way, but also because they look down upon any outside influences."[^20] @Chaudhry:2016, @DupuyRonPrakash:2015, and @DupuyRonPrakash:2016 find similar results: states overwhelmingly take political concerns into account when deciding to limit the activities of NGOs. 

In addition to their gatekeeping goals, foreign funding laws are also designed to co-opt NGO programs and capture NGO resources. Many governments create avenues—both legal and extralegal—for non-contentious organizations to receive foreign funds, but according to respondents, these roads allow the government to be "unjustly confiscatory"[^21] and can redirect funds from NGOs to the government. Transferring foreign funds to the government can happen at a formal, de jure level. Similar to the Russian Public Chamber system, which forces NGOs to channel all resources through a government agency, respondents note that working through India's Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) is the only way to legally obtain foreign money. The FCRA allows the government to dictate which organizations can receive money and gives it the ability to seize or freeze the assets of unwanted organizations, thus capturing NGO resources [@press-trust-india:2015].[^22] 

Transfers to the government can also happen at an informal level. Respondents report that government officials in authoritarian regimes "solicit for opportunities to benefit unconditionally from international NGO resources";[^23] for many INGOs that rely on foreign funds, "either you give the government money or you are out."[^24] The inefficiencies imposed by resource-related laws lead to the second step in the process for capturing resources and compromising values: the temptation to turn to extralegal methods for avoiding delays. An INGO working in the Caribbean reports that "every regulation or law gives a potential pretext for an official or policeman to attempt to solicit a bribe."[^25] These bribes and side payments act as "speed money," [@Bardhan:1997, 1323] allowing organizations to dodge bureaucratic hurdles while simultaneously allowing regime officials to take foreign money. 

However, enriching repressive governments and using informal and illegal backchannels to avoid inefficiencies can challenge INGOs' core values. Several respondents reported that they resist efforts to co-opt their organizations through corruption and capture, but that the resistance hurts the effectiveness of their missions. For instance, a disaster relief INGO working in South Asia notes "[t]here is a lot of bureaucracy and corruption. We spend so much time to get approval in the projects[.] We don’t agree to pay bribe, which makes or work even more difficult [sic]"[^26]—the organization's reluctance to accede to overtures of corruption means that they are stuck with inefficiencies. A development INGO working in the Caribbean describes how avoiding contact with inefficient and expensive bureaucrats directly conflicts with their values:

> We are supposed to be signed up for [national social security], however all the workers want no part of it because they say that people pay in, but nobody can ever collect payment unless they are friends with a senator. We have not signed up, and are therefore out of compliance with the law. There is also … [national] employee medical [insurance]. If an employer pays into that, the employees have to go to [government] hospitals and can’t receive care otherwise. The closest hospital is 90 minutes away and has 1 doctor. The employees asked if they could please stick with the current system, which is simply that the organization directly manages care and pays all bills for work related injuries. *We are out of compliance, and in principle I don’t like being out of compliance.*[^27]

This organization's struggle to balance its preference to avoid government corruption and bottlenecks against its preference to comply with government regulations is emblematic of regimes' larger effort to encourage shifts in INGO missions through co-optation and control. Resource regulations purposely create inefficiencies to force INGOs to funnel additional money through their host governments, which in turn potentially distorts INGO values. In the end, this INGO chose to not comply with government demands for control and co-optation, but in exchange, the scope of their programming is inherently more limited as the organization avoids all contact with the government and hides its activities as much as possible.

The pressure to concede to government demands is particularly strong for non-contentious organizations: import controls, bribes, and employment regulations target organizations that have a physical presence in the country and that deal with physical goods like aid and development supplies. Unlike their high-contention counterparts, these types of organizations are generally less concerned with forcing political changes and are therefore more likely to follow government regulations and allow for some degree of capture. INGOs with low instrumental flexibility—those with few employees, few sources of revenue, and limited partnerships—are especially prone to threats of co-optation and capture. 

Many small, low-contention respondents indicated that they had changed their funding structure to allow for increased government control. Several reported that they had begun receiving funding directly from government offices (similar to Russia's Public Chamber system), either channeling foreign donations through those offices or receiving government money directly.[^28] Another explained that they "looked [for donations] more within [their host country] and less for funding support linked to foreign [donors]" in response to stricter laws related to funding and employment.[^29] Organizations are often aware that partnering with the government can lead to resource and program capture, but with limited resources, they are unable to avoid it—INGOs must spend "a lot of [time and money] to organzie [sic] so as to not be covered by the regs.[^30] Rather than fight against regulations, low flexibility organizations reluctantly follow along in pursuit of their mission.

Organizations can limit the degree of capture they face, though, by drawing on their flexibility. One agricultural assistance INGO working in Central Africa complained that "[w]e are supposed to partner with government services in the field, but they have no budgets and no vision." Regardless, the organization pays the necessary fees to bureaucrats and funnels money through specified government channels, in compliance with regulations. As expected, this money disappears and their government partners "do not deliver invoices to prove their expenses," since "[m]ost of the time they are only looking for control over the means and predating on the income of the farmers or of any kind of economic activity" by guest INGOs.[^31] At first glance, it appears that bureaucrats successfully capture a portion of the INGO's resources and limit their effectiveness in the country. However, because the organization has a high degree of flexibility—dozens of staff members in their home country, hundreds of volunteers in their target countries, and substantial funding from large UN agencies—it moves around the country to remote areas far from the capital, where capture and co-optation would be more severe. The INGO is able to draw on its resources to optimize their various in-country headquarters to minimize the amount of money bureaucrats can take. 

An education INGO working in East Africa follows a similar strategy and operates in remote and neglected areas of the country without consent from the country's Ministry of Education. The organization is happy to do so to avoid capture: "We think it’s better like that, because if we ask for permission, we should certenly pay a lot (admistrative fees for nothing !) [sic]."[^32] This INGO differs from the organization that allowed a modicum of capture, though, in the amount of flexibility it enjoys. While the organization in Central Africa has a large budget backed by prominent IGOs, the organization in East Africa receives the bulk of its funding from individual and corporate donors, which have been volatile revenue streams, with many donors ending their support following the financial crisis of 2008–09. As a result, the organization is unable to afford the necessary minimum administrative fees or bribes to merit increased access to the country, thus reducing the "visibility and recognition" of its work in the country. The organization gladly protects against captured revenue and coerced changes to its programs, but without sufficient flexibility in revenue, it remains on the margins.

When facing laws that increase government control of resources, INGOs can adjust how they fund their work to prevent capture. A humanitarian assistance INGO working in a Middle Eastern country that taxes large foreign transfers avoids these additional fees by funding their organization irregularly and in smaller tranches, effectively hiding these transfers from government bureaucrats on the lookout for consistently large sums of money.[^33] Other organizations limit the amount of money their in-country offices handle and instead "transfer funds to activists and other NGOs within the country."[^34] Transferring money to other actors helps the INGO stay off the government's radar, but it is also limiting for organizations with fewer resources. One human rights organization working in Southeast Asia sends the majority of its money to activists, but it struggles to maintain regular funding streams. The INGO only has one employee that deals with fundraising, with "no one behind the [employee] to support his work, or to succeed him if he leaves the organization with some institutional knowledge." Assigning all the organization's fundraising efforts to one person, especially when much of the funding cannot be retained in the INGO itself because of the organization's strategy of avoiding funding restrictions "makes it difficult to accomplish current goals or to plan for the future." With greater funding and flexibility, the organization could better avoid restrictions and "accomplish significantly more work."[^35]


# Managerial capture: regulating oversight

Approximately three fourths of respondents indicated that they face moderate to substantial restrictions on their operations once they are set up in their host countries (see @fig:regs-faced-capture).[^36] One common form of operational restriction occurs through oversight regulation, which allows governments to weigh in on INGO programming and influence their programs. Governments are can be closely—and sometimes directly—involved in INGO management, particularly in authoritarian contexts. The left panel of @fig:freq-both shows that organizations working in both types of regimes tend to be in fairly regular contact with the government, with the majority of INGOs meeting with officials at some level of government at least once a year. This diverges from how often INGOs claim to be required to submit formal reports to the government in the right panel of @fig:freq-both. The majority of organizations working in democracies—roughly 40% of all respondents—do not have any official reporting requirements, while a little over 15% of organizations working in democracies are required to report annually. In contrast, organizations that target autocracies are much more likely to need to report, more likely to check in at least annually with the government, and are more likely to need to report more than once a year. Autocracies thus have a heavier hand in INGO affairs, requiring more formal reporting and oversight than their democratic counterparts.

![Frequency of contact with government and formal reporting to government](../../Output/figures/3-freq-both){#fig:freq-both}

In addition to demanding oversight through reporting, one common method states use to manage international NGOs is to position government officials within the governance structures of these organizations. 

 In the previous case study on China, I described how the Chinese government now requires that all international NGOs have a formal sponsor from the Communist Party. Many responding organizations report similar arrangements in their countries. In Eastern Europe, an MP who chairs the education committee personally monitors the educational programming of one INGO,[^37] a foreign affairs minister works directly with an education INGO in South America,[^38] and the former president of a European nation is a member of and consults for a human rights INGO, representing the diplomatic interests of their country through the NGO's programming.[^39] The consequences of going against government preferences when officials are so closely involved in INGO decisions are unclear—few respondents with bureaucrats and politicians in their organizations opted to describe what might happen. However, a human rights INGO working in East Africa explained that officials "could close down the project" if government demands are not met.[^40]

Regulations can give bureaucrats final say in INGO programming even without formal participation in governance. An advocacy organization working in West Africa must have its work checked and approved by the government and its programs are sometimes vetoed and "over powered,"[^41] while other organizations are required to get final ministry-level approval for their activities, programs, and publications.[^42] In other cases, regulations dictate that INGO programming falls under the direct supervision and control of local governments, leaving organizations with little flexibility in how they operate, essentially turning them into arms of the government—an organization working in West Africa had several of its programmatic themes subsumed by the government,[^43] with bureaucrats determining which activities the NGO should handle.

Finally, regulations regarding INGO management and operations can inadvertently give governments control over some aspects of their advocacy and programming, in particular when regulations do not map directly onto INGO strategies. An orphanage working in Central Asia provides a helpful example. The organization's host country requires that all international NGOs dealing with orphans guarantee full funding for each child for a full calendar year, beginning in January each year. This rule provides stability for the country's foreign-supported orphans and gives the government the ability to lock in and capture INGO programming. In accordance with the host country's requirements that orphans be funded for a full calendar year, the INGO encourages its private and corporate donors to sponsor children for a full twelve months, but donors can donate at any time during the year (not just in January), and donors "may pull out of their sponsorship at anytime of the year." When sponsorships dry up or appear irregularly, the organization faces difficult financial decisions:

> We are not allowed by the … government to withdraw the names of orphans sponsored until the end of each year even if we did not receive funding for that orphan but we still must pay for that orphan until the end of each year.[^44]

This regulation puts substantial strain on the organization's resources and allows the government to force the orphanage to dip into its general fund to guarantee its services. Other respondents report similar instances where host governments use bureaucratic delays and rules to lock INGOs into their programs—significant delays in different stages of project approval force an INGO working in South Asia to "keep the project running without the funds. We need to use our limited NGO resource to implement the project."[^45] This indirect form of control allows the government to guarantee access to INGO services regardless of donor cash flow, but imposes significant financial burdens on those organizations. 

How INGOs respond to government attempts to become involved in organizational decisions depends on their reserves of instrumental flexibility. In the absence of reliable funding, well-trained staff, or support from larger organizations, INGOs can involuntarily shift their programming in the regime's favor. The Central Asian orphanage is locked into its programs because it cannot control donor behavior and has no other consistent streams of income, while other organizations deplete their limited budgets to keep projects active, again because of a lack of flexibility in revenue. 

As they do in response to other types of regulation, INGOs can hide within or withdraw from the country to avoid more direct managerial capture. Doing so, however, requires additional resources to pay for relocation and remote management. For instance, an INGO advocating for HIV patients in Southern Africa faced recurrent "[p]olitical intrusion and manipulation from [a] local Member of Parliament," which led the organization to "be more selective on focus locations" and move its offices to avoid managerial oversight.[^46] This regular relocation puts financial strain on the INGO, though, and makes it difficult to "hav[e] enough finances and resources" to undertake their work—maintaining instrumental flexibility remains a challenge for the organization. In another case, a children's rights and education INGO in India works from abroad to avoid managerial capture. To register as an international NGO, the organization would need to have "a fully Indian board of directors,"[^47] which would open it up to indirect government control (with bureaucrats on the local board). To prevent this type of capture, the INGO is registered as a "liaison office," which prohibits direct implementation of activities, but permits direct collaboration with domestic NGOs. Working in exile forces the organization to spend considerable time managing its domestic partners while simultaneously maintaining contacts with oversight authorities to ensure that its collaboration remains legal. Because it is funded primarily by grants from its home government, the INGO has enough financial resources to dedicate staff time to remotely manage its myriad in-country partnerships—without this flexibility, the organization would likely struggle to effectively operate from abroad.

Having bureaucrats involved in organizational decision making does not always disadvantage INGOs. @Teets:2014 has shown that INGOs working in China systematically shop for the optimal oversight agency, work carefully to build positive relationships with their local officials, and seek to provide tangible benefits for their government sponsors by providing needed services and offering crucial expertise. INGO respondents confirm this finding, with many describing their efforts to cultivate relationships with politicians and bureaucrats. A human rights INGO working in Western Africa learned that the current and former ministers of justice were both personally opposed to the death penalty. The organization built rapport with the ministry and provided information, tools, and advice to the ministers to help them work toward national abolition of the death penalty. These close connections have subsequently helped the INGO obtain legal status in the country. In 2016, one of the INGO's local partner organizations faced a noticeably smooth registration process because of its work with the government, and as a result, the larger organization has faced little pressure to tone down their abolition efforts.[^48] 

As explained in the previous chapter, one common reaction to gatekeeping regulations is to outsource compliance with those laws to domestic partners who can deal with labor, tax, and other regulatory issues required to enter and stay in the country. INGOs follow a similar strategy to protect against managerial capture by stacking their local offices with staff who are the most knowledgeable and best positioned to work with the organization's assigned government liaisons. At one extreme, a European human rights INGO working in East Africa purposely does not employ European staff in its country offices due to concerns of foreign staff safety when working with bureaucrats. Instead, the organization ensures that only locals "deal with the government official [sic]," since they are most aware of the dangers of doing so.[^49] 

More commonly, INGOs outsource their operations to local staff in response to increased managerial oversight not out of concerns of safety, but to improve their relationship with their host governments and improve their chances of program success. A youth development organization working in the Middle East reports that the government is "not really trusting of youth organizations, especially international organizations." To overcome this trust gap, the organization purposely increases its contact with the government officials tasked with its oversight. The INGO relies on a local team to contact and lobby the government and ensures that officials are invited "to be a part of our programs."[^50] Other INGOs pursue similar strategies, inviting government staff, officials, police, and judges to serve in advisory positions on specific projects and programs and encouraging bureaucrats to participate in stakeholder meetings, with the explicit goal of increasing their influence and standing with key decision makers.[^51]

Cultivating relationships with government officials requires time and resources. Thus, when they enjoy sufficient flexibility and are able to make consistent and positive contact with oversight agencies, INGOs can harness and shape direct government involvement in their favor, pushing back against—and even reversing—regime attempts to shift or tame organizational missions and ideals. In the absence of flexibility, though, INGOs are more likely to find themselves locked into expensive programming that benefits the host regime or  come under direct government management.


# Index on Censorship

Evidence from the survey shows the variety of creative strategies INGOs use to counteract government attempts at capture. Because INGOs are concerned primarily with protecting their missions rather than remaining in the country, working in exile is a fairly common response to capture-related regulations. Index on Censorship is a prime example of an international NGO working almost exclusively from abroad, using its headquarters in London to aggravate and shame repressive governments while avoiding supporting their regimes.

## Mission and strategy

In 1972, amid American debates over the newly leaked *Pentagon Papers* and a Soviet crackdown on dissident writers such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Natalya Gorbanevskaya, British authors Stephen Spender and Michael Scammel began publishing a quarterly magazine entitled *Index on Censorship*.[^52] The editors laid out their primary motivation in its inaugural issue, declaring that "[f]reedom of expression is not self-perpetuating, but rather has to be maintained through the constant vigilance of those who care about it."[^53] The magazine was designed to serve as a vehicle for this constant vigilance in three different ways. First, the journal solicits articles that "record and analyse all forms of inroads into freedom of expression," publishing political and legal research related to anti-freedom of expression laws around the world [@Spender:1972, 13]. Second, the journal acts as sort of literary magazine, providing an outlet for censored artists, writers, poets, and musicians by publishing their work on an international platform. Finally, the organization uses the journal as an advocacy tool with its annual "Index Index," where it highlights and chronicles arrests, instances of censorship, and other violations of freedom of expression around the world, with the intention of shaming the states that engage in these crackdowns.

Since 1972, Index on Censorship has evolved into a fully fledged nonprofit advocacy organization and a prominent voice in promoting freedom of expression rights around the globe. The mission of today's Index on Censorship, under the leadership of CEO Jodie Ginsberg, comprises four components: informing, influencing, debating, and supporting.[^54] Index *informs* the public about ongoing threats to freedom of expression by continuing to publish the *Index on Censorship* magazine on a quarterly basis, in addition to publishing regular reports and analysis on their website and social media accounts. The organization *influences* policy by selecting topics and countries where they feel they can have the most impact—due to staff expertise in the region or issue, or because few other organizations have taken up the issue in the given country—and by launching advocacy campaigns to shame offending governments, call for the release of prisoners, or lobby for changes in laws. Its Index Index and its Mapping Media Freedom project[^55]—the modern incarnation of the Index Index which collects real-time crowdsourced reports of threats and violations of media freedom—are also central to the organization's advocacy and influencing mission. Index encourages *debate* about issues of expression by hosting public events such as talks, concerts, and performances in their headquarters in London. Finally the organization *supports* those facing censorship by presenting annual jury-selected Freedom of Expression Awards to organizations and individuals that it feels deserve special recognition for their journalism, activism, or art.

## Sources of flexibility

Publishing more than 250 magazine issues while simultaneously lobbying and advocating against censorious governments requires a substantial amount of resources. Complicating its mission, repressive governments limit Index's access to their countries with gatekeeping laws and attempt to capture the organization's resources and harness its programs for their own benefit. When facing program capture regulations, INGOs are primarily concerned with protecting their missions and resisting government efforts to control or co-opt their programs. Index on Censorship's instrumental flexibility—with its consistent income, small staff, and wide networks of freelancers and collaborators—allows it to protect itself and its foreign partners from threats of capture.

Compared to Article 19, with its regional offices spread throughout the world and multi-million pound budget, Index on Censorship is a lean organization, with an average income of roughly £850,000 over the past eight years (see top panel of @fig:index-budget-staff). Index's budget has been relatively stable over time as well—the largest recent fluctuation in its income occurred from 2011–13 with an influx of grants for projects in the post-Arab Spring Middle East. Index's income comes from multiple sources, including donations from individuals; smaller foundations such as the Eranda Foundation, the David & Elaine Potter Foundation, and Fritt Ord; larger foundations like the Open Society Institute; and corporations like Google, Twitter, Facebook, and The Guardian. The organization also benefits from sales of its *Index on Censorship* magazine.[^56] 

![Index on Censorship's income, expenditures, and full time staff, 2008–15](../../Output/figures/5-index-budget-staff){#fig:index-budget-staff}

In contrast with Article 19, Index tends to avoid income from government agencies. It does not eschew them entirely—its Mapping Media Freedom project is funded, in part, by the European Commission [@index:2015, 6]—but it is extremely careful in how it pursues them. In most cases, Index shies away from government funders because their income could pose a direct threat to the organization's programs. When the organization does accept government funds, it maintains a Chinese wall between itself and its funders, limiting their involvement in its projects "so they don't get to have any kind of influence on what we do [on] the ground."[^57] This influence from government funders can work in two ways. First, receiving government funds can have a chilling effect on the programs of human rights INGOs. Sarah @Stroup:2012 finds that American human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch are more reticent in their criticisms of rights violations committed by the United States because they receive substantial funding from US government grants. Meanwhile, UK-based organizations like Amnesty International—which, like Index, does not rely on government funds—have been far less reluctant to criticize rich, democratic countries. Since it does not fear the loss of government revenue, Index has likewise been critical of Western democracies. Index presented its 2001 Award for Services to Censorship to the UK's Ministry of Defense for prosecuting a whistleblower,[^58] and in 2004 named US Attorney General John Ashcroft as the Censor of the Year for his role in defending the USA PATRIOT Act and arguing for the legality of the Guantanamo Bay military prison.[^59] Second, government funding can influence the perceptions of the organization's programs in more repressive countries. Taking money from the US State Department, for example, would harm Index's efforts in nations in conflict with the United States, allowing regimes to discount Index's advocacy as merely an arm of American foreign policy.[^60] Avoiding government grants thus allows Index to remain contentious toward democracies and maintain its independence and perceptions of objectivity when targeting autocracies. The organization's consistent streams of revenue from private donors, foundations, and corporations provides Index with the flexibility to avoid controversial and potentially damaging government grants.

Index on Censorship's London office is run by a small staff of 8–14 people who develop the organization's mission and strategy and oversee its operations (see top panel of @fig:index-budget-staff). Much of the organization's work, however, is done through freelance journalists and activists associated with Index. The magazine commissions work from foreign correspondents and the organization's research teams communicate with researchers in the various countries they target. Index's small staff limits the number of countries the organization can target simultaneously. In accordance with its mission to influence freedom of expression policy, Index selects two to three countries each year that necessitate special attention. These countries are chosen deliberately based on staff expertise, personal connections with domestic NGOs, activists, and journalists, or alignment with specific funders.[^61] Index then works to "influence the policy makers and the general media to put pressure on those governments" and attempt to induce reforms by supporting freelance journalists and activists in these countries, protesting against those governments' embassies in the UK, and by creating resources in London that can be delivered to people on the ground.[^62] In the lead up to the first European Games, held in Azerbaijan in June 2015, Index participated in protests outside the Azerbaijan Embassy in London, "calling for an end to the ongoing human rights crackdown in Azerbaijan, and the release of the country’s jailed journalists and human rights defenders" [@a19-azerbaijan:2015]. The organization also created special "guidance packs" that it distributed to foreign sports correspondents on their way to cover the games in Baku, offering warnings about how to stay safe and advice on how to best cover the country's human rights abuses. In spite of its small size, Index's intense needling prompted a perturbed response from Azerbaijan's ambassador, and the organization considered the campaign a success [@index:2015, 7].

![Index on Censorship award winners, 2001–2016](../../Output/figures/5-index-awards){#fig:index-awards}

Index expands the reach of its advocacy through its annual Freedom of Expression Awards. These awards are well suited to the organization's small size, as they require minimal staff resources to undertake, but have the potential to empower and boost the influence of recipients. Index solicits nominations for awards celebrating activists involved in arts, political campaigning, digital activism, and journalism, and winners are selected by a panel of volunteer judges. Since 2001, Index has given 79 awards to recipients in 42 different countries, predominantly in more restrictive autocracies (see @fig:index-awards). Index promotes award winners through press releases and media coverage (especially in *The Guardian*, one of Index's corporate sponsors), and highlights their work in its magazine, providing winners with international recognition and allowing the organization to shame recipients' home countries.

Relying on the awards for a deliberate expansion of Index's global advocacy work, however, is impossible, as the selection committee has no control over who is nominated. In a given year, award winners rarely come from countries where Index engages in deeper advocacy work. For instance, in 2016, Index ran targeted campaigns in Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Turkey, but its five award winners came from Burkina Faso, China, Pakistan, Syria, and Yemen. As such, the awards are often not linked to Index's overall advocacy strategy. However, the global distribution of award recipients can provide the organization with additional resources in the future, and award winners can assist with Index's more formal advocacy efforts. In 2012, the organization presented its advocacy award to the president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights (BCHR), Nabeel Rajab, who gained international prominence for his role in protesting against the Bahraini government during the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Index was able to draw on its relationship with Rajab and BCHR when it helped lead a successful campaign to release Maryam Al-Khawaja—a Bahraini activist and daughter of one of the founders of BCHR, Abdulhadi Alkhawaja—after she was imprisoned in September 2014 under charges of assaulting a police officer [@index:2015]. Though the award had been presented two years earlier, Index had maintained its relationship with Rajab and was well positioned to continue to advocate for human rights activists in the country, continuing through the organization's ongoing Bahrain campaign.[^63]

Finally, Index cultivates collaborative relationships with organizations beyond its awards program. For instance, Index is a member of the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (IFEX) and has partnered with member organizations to engage in country-specific advocacy campaigns. Prior to the Arab Spring uprisings, Index worked with Article 19 and other groups in IFEX's Tunisia Monitoring Group (IFEX-TMG) and contributed to the Group's reports and recommendations, relying on the cover of the working group to gain safe access to the country. Additionally, by partnering with IFEX-TMG members and local Tunisian and Egyptian NGOs, Index built on those relationships and sponsored training sessions for media rights activists throughout Tunisia in 2011 [@index:2012, 4]. Collaboration thus plays a key role in Index's flexibility. With few permanent employees and a single office in London the organization by necessity has to rely on other organizations and activists to effectively engage in its programming. 

## Protecting mission from abroad

Survey responses revealed several methods governments use to capture the benefits and resources of INGOs in their country. Resource-related regulations attempt to take some control of the money, expertise, and programs of guest INGOs, while oversight regulations allow governments to assert managerial control over some programming decisions. These laws can pull an organization's core mission, vision, and values closer in line with government preferences, leading to tamer, less confrontational programming. Index on Censorship takes a unique approach to avoiding program capture regulations: it protects its core mission by running all its campaigns and advocacy from its base in London, thereby avoiding the influence of repressive countries.

This strategy is rooted, in part, to Index's historical legacy as a magazine. For decades, Index has been a publisher and a platform, acting as a gadfly from London and using its journal to distribute its criticisms globally. The organization's later advocacy-focused programs have continued in this vein. In parallel with its strategy of publishing works from authors in other countries, Index has made a "very conscious decision not to parachute in a bunch of foreigners to assess the situation and then report back,"[^64] and instead relies on activists, journalists, and authors in other countries to report on violations of expression rights and lobby for policy improvements. The organization thus protects against intrusions on its own core mission by not attempting to maintain a legal presence in its target countries. Not only would such a process be time- and resource-intensive, it could compromise their ability to effectively shame governments and support dissidents journalists, musicians, and artists, since such support would run afoul of gatekeeping regulations and risk their registration status.[^65] Index's small budget, lean staff, and large network shape the organization's strategy and programs—it cannot target all countries in the world, but maintains a global footprint from its headquarters in London. These resources provide the organization with flexibility to avoid government-induced changes to its programming and help it maintain the contentiousness of its advocacy.

Generally, governments try to avoid the shaming and negative attention from INGOs like Index on Censorship. As explored previously, countries care about their reputations and often bristle when they receive poor rankings in global indexes or when they are compared negatively to peer nations [@Kelley:2017; @KelleySimmons:2015]. To protect themselves against the potentially destabilizing effect of negative press, governments will limit INGOs with gatekeeping laws. However, organizations like Index circumvent gatekeeping laws by working with domestic partners. While Index insulates itself from program-related regulations by remaining in London, it is also aware that its foreign partners—its freelancers, award recipients, and partners—are susceptible to closure, capture, or co-optation. Not only do foreign partners connected with Western NGOs face the possibility of arrest, the perception of Western support ensures they are targets for resource capture, as governments use foreign funding restrictions, import regulations, and visa rules to limit or seize payments and award money.

At the same time, repressive governments can benefit from having international attention, spinning negative press into a demonstration of positive developments. Index has come across this in its own work, noting that some of the central Asian countries it has targeted have highlighted the fact that activists have received international awards. Allowing a handful of dissident media outlets and activists to operate unencumbered can lend regimes legitimacy and assist with institutional balancing—repressive governments can essentially say, "Hey! We still have investigative outlets. We still have some human rights organizations. You can't say we're completely authoritarian."[^66] Governments can thus derive some benefit from Index's advocacy, capturing and reversing the purpose of their programming.[^67] 

Index works closely with its foreign partners to ensure that (1) the organization's freelancers, award recipients, and collaborators remain safe, (2) the resources the organization provides to its partners are protected from resource capture, and (3) its partners control the public relations narrative of their advocacy. When communicating with its foreign contacts, the organization's staff in London try to follow cryptographic best practices, relying on virtual private networks (VPNs) and encrypted services such as Signal[^68] or PGP[^69] to bypass internet filters and avoid surveillance by repressive regimes. 

To enhance its support of award recipients and institutionalize methods for avoiding resource capture, in 2015 Index expanded its awards program and now provides recipients with a one-year fellowship of personalized support, including a weeklong training in London and continued assistance with practical issues, such as website design, digital security, and professional networking [@index:2015, 5]. By bringing recipients to London, the organization can avoid visa rules that limit their access to recipients' home countries while circumventing foreign funding and import control laws, giving awards and specialized training to recipients in person. Finally, in an effort to ensure safety and to control the narrative about the recipient's activism (thereby pre-empting any public relations capture), Index consults with each collaborator about how to best present their award and frame the announcement in its press releases and subsequent media campaign.[^70]


# International Republican Institute

To protect the contentiousness of its anti-authoritarian mission from government attempts to limit or capture its programs, Index on Censorship relies on its global network of journalists and activists to work from abroad. Not all contentious INGOs work so strictly in exile, however. Many INGOs that deal with issues that have the potential to destabilize their host regimes work *within* those regimes, even when facing heavy restrictions. The experience of the International Republican Institute (IRI) demonstrates how INGOs can effectively work within restrictive countries while simultaneously conserving their contentiousness. 

## Mission and strategy

In 1983, as part of President Ronald Reagan's push for increased global democratization, Congress passed the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) Act, which established an eponymous charitable foundation backed by more than $30 million from the US State Department.[^71] The NED was "premised on the idea that American assistance on behalf of democracy efforts abroad would be good both for the U.S. and for those struggling around the world for freedom and self-government," [@ned-lowe] and since its creation, it has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into democratization and political development projects around the world. The NED does not engage in practical, on-the-ground democracy promotion advocacy—instead, it channels its government grants through four main partner organizations: the Center for International Private Enterprise (CIPE), backed by the US Chamber of Commerce; the Solidarity Center, associated with the AFL-CIO; the National Democratic Institute of International Affairs (NDI), loosely affiliated with the US Democratic Party; and IRI, loosely affiliated with the US Republican Party [@Bush:2015, 110].[^72] 

In the 1980s, IRI used its NED funds to engage in democracy promotion activities primarily in Latin America, and following the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, it expanded its operations to Eastern Europe. Today it runs programs in 86 countries throughout the world (see @fig:iri-work). Since its creation, IRI's work has been centered on elections, and the organization has become of the world's most credible international election monitoring organizations [@Kelley:2012, 120], observing more than 200 elections in 57 countries.[^73] In addition to monitoring elections, IRI also trains candidates and political parties in the election process, provides technical assistance for election commissions, and helps with general election preparedness. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, elections became a standard fixture of authoritarian politics, though, and the politicians that won in IRI-observed elections were regularly swept out of power in subsequent less-democratic elections. IRI adjusted by expanding the scope of its election-focused programming.[^74] Instead of appearing on the scene a few weeks before an election, IRI began working with election officials six to twelve months in advance and staying actively engaged for several months after the election. 

![IRI program locations, 2017](../../Output/figures/5-iri-work){#fig:iri-work}

Beyond longer-term election monitoring, IRI's mission today encompasses a more expansive vision of democracy promotion:

> IRI encourages democracy in places where it is absent, helps democracy become more effective where it is in danger, and shares best practices where democracy is flourishing.[^75]

Today, IRI's programing is designed to improve the political and social infrastructure for electoral democracy. The organization continues to engage in election-focused work, including trainings in multi-party political systems and governance in emerging democracies. But much of IRI's work is now aimed at cultivating civil society, increasing citizen involvement in government, and engaging marginalized groups—in particular women and youth—in the political process.[^76]

## Sources of flexibility

IRI's close affiliation with the NED and the US democracy promotion establishment provide the organization with multiple key sources of flexibility, including large and reliable sources of income, deep connections with the US government, and a wide global presence. This instrumental flexibility, in turn, allows the organization to maneuver within the uncertain regulatory, political, and social environments of the countries it works in and resist government attempts at capturing their programs.

Compared to Article 19, AMERA, and Index on Censorship, IRI's budget is massive—its average income from 2004–2015 was $70.4 million, more than 18 times larger than the other three INGOs combined (see @fig:iri-budget-staff).[^77] Nearly 100% of its revenue comes from government grants, primarily from the State Department, USAID, and the NED. While this guarantees access to a substantial pool of resources and allows IRI to have a global presence, its reliance on government funds also poses potential barriers to its advocacy abroad. First, IRI's revenue is deeply connected to trends in domestic American politics and can reflect the priorities of US foreign policy. For instance, in his 2004 State of the Union Address, in the early days of American military intervention in Iraq and Afghanistan, President George W. Bush proposed doubling the NED's budget in order to "to focus its new work on the development of free elections, and free markets, free press, and free labor unions in the Middle East" [@Bush:2004]. Accordingly, IRI's revenue more than doubled between 2004 and 2005, peaking at nearly $100 million in 2009–2010, including $18.5 million in two State Department grants to fund its observation of the 2010 Iraqi parliamentary elections [@iri:2009]. Under President Barack Obama, however, IRI's income declined steadily as its programs in Iraq wound down and the NED's priorities shifted elsewhere. Domestic politics can also deplete IRI's funding—the Trump administration's proposed 2018 budget proposes a 40% cut in funding to the State Department, USAID, and the NED, which would subsequently lead to a substantial drawdown in IRI's programming if approved by Congress [@ToosiEverett:2017; @Wadhams:2017].

![IRI's income, expenditures, and full time staff, 2004–15](../../Output/figures/5-iri-budget-staff){#fig:iri-budget-staff}

Second, reliance on government funds influences perceptions of IRI's autonomy and objectivity. IRI claims to be nonpartisan and independent, but it has struggled to shake off perceptions of US government influence. In the 1980s, scholars argued that it was being wielded as a weapon in the "'war of ideas' between communism and democracy" [@Carothers:1994, 134] and that it has been too closely linked to US foreign policy interests. Its missions since then can also be traced to US foreign policy goals—President Bush strategically used the NED, and IRI in turn, throughout his presidency to help reshape political structures in concert with American military action in the Middle East. The organization also maintains a close affiliation with conservative political figures and is often accused of promoting right-wing values [@Shelley:2000, 227]. Republican US senator John McCain has been chair of IRI's board since 2003, and the board includes many former and current Republican members of Congress including Kelly Ayotte, Tom Cotton, Kay Bailey Hutchison, and Mark Kirk.[^78] 

Despite these political and perceptual hurdles, IRI's complete reliance on government funding provides it with financial flexibility as it adapts its programs to the changing political contexts of its target countries. Funding from nominally independent donors like the NED gives IRI access to countries that USAID and the State Department either cannot access or are uninterested in. IRI has used NED funds to work in countries like China, Cuba, and Sudan, where the US government has been banned by law from providing foreign aid [@Epstein:1999, 2], and it has relied on NED grants to work in smaller countries like Gambia that pose less strategic interest for the State Department or USAID.[^79]

Similar to Article 19, which relies on a handful of in-country offices to improve the reach of its mission, a second source of IRI's instrumental flexibility its global presence. The scale of IRI's international work, though, is enormous. The organization works in more than 80 different countries and maintains 30–35 field offices staffed by 200–400 in-field employees. Working in its target countries is an essential part of IRI's mission. IRI makes a claim similar to Index on Censorship, which makes a conscious effort "not to parachute in a bunch of foreigners"[^80] when working abroad, but takes a different approach—Index remains in London, while IRI embeds itself abroad. With its shift away from basic election monitoring, rather than parachute into a country and present a preset menu of democratization programs, IRI now makes long-term commitments to the countries it works in and plans on remaining for many years. Recognizing that democracy is a "long term, iterative process,"[^81] IRI develops networks of domestic civil society and political leaders to further its mission of democratization. IRI's dozens of field offices allow the organization to maintain robust in-country presence and keep in contact with domestic partners that help the organization pay attention to the political, economic, legal, and social contexts of its host countries.

IRI field offices and field employees, 2009–2015
</div>

While some of its field offices are more permanent, many are set up temporarily according to the needs of the country and proximity to other states in the region. For instance, for several months in 2016, IRI maintained a small temporary office in Gambia, and from a single field office in the Sahel, IRI runs trainings and works with activists in multiple neighboring countries because of linguistic, cultural, and geographic proximity.[^82] @fig:iri-regional-staff demonstrates the volatility of the distribution of IRI's regional offices and employees, with rapid shifts in personnel and headquarters over time, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, where many countries have passed restrictive NGO laws. IRI's large network of field offices enables it to respond quickly to changing needs and remain embedded in its target countries for the long term. Crucially, it also allows the organization to effectively confront anti-NGO crackdowns and avoid regulations aimed at capturing their programs.

## Protecting mission with flexibility

Changes in the civil society regulatory environment of IRI's target countries influence the types of programming IRI can engage in. Because IRI has a large amount of instrumental flexibility, though, the practical operating environment—or the overlap in IRI's and the government's preferences—tends to be large, even amidst regulatory pressure and anti-NGO crackdowns. IRI draws on its reserves of resources to insulate its mission from regime capture and remain engaged in its democratization efforts despite some governments' attempts to shut them down.

IRI's deep connection to the US government provides the organization with legal and political support in its target countries. In order to obtain grants from government agencies like USAID and the State Department, IRI must prove its compliance with local laws, and they are encouraged by their funders to "play ball, follow regulations, and get registered."[^83] As such, IRI is in the process of registration or has completed its registration in all the countries it works in.[^84] Complying with gatekeeping rules is often streamlined because, like Article 19, IRI bundles registration with large donor-funded projects and can work with the local US embassy to speed the process along. US support is not a panacea for gatekeeping laws, and getting through the registration process can still be slow, arbitrary, and uncertain. To register its offices in Kyrgyzstan, IRI needed to obtain a live signature from a government employee in Washington, DC—a digital, stamped, or reproduced signature was unacceptable. One of the documents in their thick application packet was deemed invalid, however, because Kyrgyz officials found a stamped signature, the organization's application was denied and delayed for nine months. Once the registration was finally approved, though, IRI faced few regulatory hurdles, and it continues to work in the country.[^85]

Having obtained formal legal status in its target countries with the assistance of the US government, IRI can continue to rely on the cover of the US government to avoid program capture. Bilateral treaties and Congressional mandates can limit foreign government control over IRI's resources and management.[^86] For instance, in 2010, Congress approved legislation ordering that all NGOs implementing NED-sponsored democracy, human rights, and governance programs "shall not be subject to the prior approval by the government of any foreign country." [@pl111-117, §7034(m)(4)]. Though the US government does not have jurisdiction over Egyptian law, this statutory protection provides INGOs implementing democratization aid with political and moral support, thus helping these organizations from laws that give target governments the ability to deny foreign funding. For instance, in its official press statement regarding its 2011 expulsion from Egypt, IRI cited this congressional provision in its condemnation of the Egyptian government [@iri-crackdown:2012, 2]. As I will explore below, this statutory protection from managerial and resource capture grew out of IRI's experiences in Egypt from 2005–2009—stymied by foreign funding laws, IRI wielded its legislative connections to pass laws that grant it (and other NGOs) additional protection when working abroad.

Finally, IRI's large budget and relationships with government aid agencies provide it with the ability to respond quickly to political and legal changes in its target countries. For example, IRI does not sign traditional contracts when working with USAID, opting instead to work under more flexible cooperative agreements. USAID contracts lay out a set of specific deliverables and provide little implementation flexibility. Cooperative agreements, on the other hand, consist of a list of broader goals and objectives for the grant, providing a margin for adapting to changes. After unforeseen political events or elections, IRI's intermediate goals might change, but the long term goals outlined in the cooperative agreement remain the same and USAID funding can continue.[^87] 

### Reacting in Russia

This donor-based flexibility was an essential element in IRI's response to its 2012 closure in Russia. In December 2012, Russia announced that IRI had been designated as a foreign agent under the country's newly passed anti-NGO law [@Rogin:2012]. As explored in chapter 3, Russia's 2006, 2012, and 2015 anti-NGO laws were part of Vladimir Putin's *gosudarstvenost* nationalist agenda, and labeling organizations as undesirable foreign agents played into the regime's public image. Similar to the positive spin governments use when they are shamed by Index on Censorship, using award recipients as proof of a free press, prosecuting foreign NGOs is a form of public relations capture—by expelling INGOs, Putin's regime could further its Russia-first agenda by proving that foreign organizations meddle in politics.

Despite their expulsion, IRI's Russia programming did not end in 2012. The organization moved its Russia staff and operations to a neighboring country in Eastern Europe and trained Russian politicians, activists, and civil society leaders from abroad. The number of people they trained decreased substantially, since providing participants with safe transportation out of the country is costly, but their programs nevertheless continued[^88]—so much so that in August 2016, the Russian prosecutor general declared that IRI was an undesirable organization in an attempt to further limit its remote work [@iri-russia-2016]. 

![IRI's expenditures by region, 2009–15](../../Output/figures/5-iri-expenditures-region){#fig:iri-expenditures-region}

IRI's rapid retreat and reestablishment in the wake of Russian attempts at negative public relations capture was possible because of the organization's flexible funding arrangements and its large network of field offices. Because their work in Russia was funded under cooperative agreements (and not contracts), USAID was quite permissive in allowing them to move their staff and change short-term programmatic priorities and objectives without modifying the terms of the original grant.[^89] Additionally, as seen in @fig:iri-regional-staff1, IRI has the greatest number of field offices and employees in Europe and the former Soviet Union, and the organization could therefore choose to relocate to one of several possible countries. Due to its large budget, IRI could afford to move its extensive Russian operations quickly and leaving the country caused minimal disruption to IRI's overall operations—@fig:iri-expenditures-region shows relatively consistent program expenditures in Europe and Russia since 2012.

### Reacting in Egypt

IRI's experience in Egypt provides another example of using flexibility to prevent managerial and public relations capture. In early 2005, then-President Hosni Mubarak announced the first competitive presidential elections, which were then followed by three rounds of regularly scheduled quinquennial parliamentary elections. The general feeling in the country was hopeful—though Mubarak's challenger Ayman Nour only received roughly 10% of the vote, "it appeared that the Egyptian government had made political reform a priority and was committed to opening the door to greater political competition" [@iri-egypt-par:2005, 3]. However, IRI's final reports of the presidential and parliamentary elections were critical of the process and the organization noted dozens of irregularities [@iri-egypt-par:2005; @iri-egypt-pres:2005]. Subsequently, Mubarak ordered IRI to close its offices and leave the country [@Bush:2015, 36]. As it would later do in Russia, IRI quickly pulled its staff from the country, moved to other regional offices, and continued its work. 

In 2006, IRI faced new restrictions on its work in Egypt, despite working from abroad. The Egyptian government began to selectively enforce the foreign funding provisions of Law 84 of 2002 against IRI, demanding that it be allowed to approve the flow of the organization's grants to local Egyptian NGOs. In response to this attempt to capture the organization's resources, IRI and other NED-funded NGOs in Egypt worked with Congress to draft a provision that would protect them from Egyptian control over NGO budgets. In the 2005 budget, Congress included a clause in its appropriations for USAID and NED funds that specifically targeted Egypt, declaring that "democracy and governance activities shall not be subject to the prior approval of the Government of Egypt" [@pl108-447, 2976]. This Egypt-specific clause remained in the budget from 2006–2009 until it became a universal injunction for all NED-associated NGOs in all countries in 2010 [@pl111-117, §7034(m)(4); @Sharp:2012, 8]. Because of its close ties to the US government, IRI thus enjoyed Congressional support for its remote work in Egypt until formally returning in 2011.

After the Arab Spring uprisings in January–February 2011, IRI continued its work in from a field office in Cairo, assisting with post-revolutionary electoral reforms, preparing candidates, activists, and political parties for the 2011 parliamentary elections, ultimately training thousands of participants.[^90] As explored in chapter 3, the regulatory environment for INGOs under the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) was uncertain and regulations based on Law 84 of 2002 were still as applied arbitrarily as they had been under Mubarak. IRI's legal partners in Egypt had advised the organization to apply for formal legal status in 2006. By 2011, the organization still had not been officially registered and it restarted the process.[^91] The absence of formal registration was not overly concerning, though. INGOs working in Egypt understood that there would never be any real end to the registration process and that having an application under review was ordinarily sufficient.[^92]

On December 29, 2011, however, Egyptian security used IRI's lack of registration as a pretext to raid its three offices in Cairo, Alexandria, and Luxor, arresting 17 staff members and confiscating the organization's equipment, supplies, and cash [@iri-crackdown:2012]. The raids on IRI were part of a larger anti-INGO operation that included NDI, Freedom House, and the International Center for Journalists. The raids led to a year-long public trial *in absentia* for the NGO staff involved, and in June 2013, 43 NGO employees—including 17 Americans—were sentenced to 1–5 years in prison [@Loveluck:2013]. Most foreign NGO staff avoided prison and left the country before the trial, including IRI's country director Sam LaHood, who took refuge with several other IRI employees in the US embassy until the end of January 2012, when they were flown out on a State Department plane [@Fadel:2012]. 

On its face, Egypt's sudden NGO raid in 2011 appears to be motivated by gatekeeping concerns, with authorities trying to remove organizations it had deemed problematic. While this may be true to some extent, the incident has an element of public relations flair, similar to Russia's 2012 expulsion of its foreign agent NGOs. During the actual uprising in January–February 2011, the regime blamed much of the violence on *ʾaydi ʾajnabiyya*,[^93] or *foreign hands*—shady Western organizations[^94] that had conspired to bring down the Egyptian government. As SCAF faced increasing political instability, ongoing riots and violence, and an uncertain future, reviving the foreign hands trope by cracking down on NGOs appeared to be a way to renew its popular support. IRI and other INGOs thus faced program capture by non-regulatory means, becoming political pawns in a negative public relations campaign designed to induce changes in their mission.

Government officials and state media, led by Mubarak-era Minister Fayza Abou el-Naga, accused IRI of "working to sow unrest in Egypt" and working as part of a joint American and Israeli plot to divide the country [@Fadel:2012]. In the court case, prosecutors used a confiscated IRI map that had separated Egypt into four shaded regions as proof that the organization was working with the CIA to split up the country—though, the divisions were simply mapping out IRI's plans to distribute observers for the parliamentary elections. Several years later, Sam LaHood spoke of this campaign, noting 

> I was smeared in public by the ludicrous accusations that I was advancing Israeli interests, seeking to break up Egypt and working against the aims of the Egyptian revolution. … These accusations would have been comical if they didn’t have such serious consequences [@LaHood:2014].

In a distortion of this chapter's title—"some state officials want your services"—SCAF hoped to capture the services of its guest INGOs and hold them up as proof of foreign machinations. By selectively enforcing its gatekeeping laws, drumming up popular support through conspiracies, and scapegoating foreign INGOs, the Egyptian regime was able to boost its popular support at home. 

IRI relied on its instrumental flexibility to insulate itself from the negative campaign and attempts at capture. As they had done in 2005, IRI took advantage of its US government connections and its network of field offices and relocated its Egypt operations either to neighboring countries or back to its headquarters in Washington, DC. Unlike the 2012 crackdown in Russia, which had minimal impact on IRI's work in the region, IRI's presence in the Middle East dropped significantly. @fig:iri-expenditures-region shows a substantial drop in expenditures in the Middle East, falling from $15.3 million in 2011 to $8.6 million in 2013.[^95] IRI's physical presence in the region also decreased during the same time period (see @fig:iri-regional-staff2). In 2011, the organization had more than 100 employees working in 10 field offices, and one year later, it had 40 employees in 6 offices. By 2013, IRI ran a single field office with 3 employees (though in 2014 its operations began to pick up again). Though it no longer maintained a regional presence, IRI worked with its project funders to get permission to shift its Egypt-focused programming abroad, and the organization continued offering out-of-country trainings and support for Egyptian politicians and activists.[^96] IRI's relationship with the US government, its large budget, its accommodating donors, and its wide geographic reach all allowed the organization to respond quickly to the raids and continue its work in Egypt.


# Conclusion

Autocracies can use NGO-related legislation to capture and co-opt INGO programming in their favor. These laws can give governments some degree of control over INGO funding and resources by imposing taxes, import controls on foreign workers and goods. Authoritarian regimes use foreign funding restrictions to either limit or take control of INGO revenue. Uneven application of civil society regulations can also force INGOs to pay bribes to circumvent legal restrictions, transferring money directly into government coffers. Repressive governments can also capture elements of INGO management, forcing organizations into programs they cannot continue to afford and placing government bureaucrats on INGOs' boards of directors. Finally, governments can selectively enforce NGO laws to boost public support for their regimes, either by praising their guest INGOs and holding them up as a sign of compliance with international norms, or by using INGOs as a scapegoat and proof of foreign conspiracies.

As with gatekeeping laws, INGOs rely on their instrumental flexibility to adapt to program capture laws. However, unlike their response gatekeeping laws, which is primarily focused on maintaining access to the country, continued presence in the country is not the ultimate goal for INGOs facing capture restrictions. Under these circumstances, organizations rely on their flexibility and act creatively to protect their missions, often opting to work in exile to avoid government intrusion. INGOs that can afford to spend additional resources to maintain their programs from a distance do so. Due to its relatively consistent revenue, its small cadre of highly trained London-based staff, and its large network of freelancers, collaborators, activists, and award recipients, Index on Censorship continues its effective globally-focused advocacy from the UK and generally avoids formal contact with governments.

In contrast, as part of its strategy to promote democratization worldwide, IRI tries to embed itself in its dozens of target countries and makes multi-year commitments to working in-country. Strengthening civil society, observing elections, and empowering marginalized groups can pose political risks to repressive regimes, however, and governments often try to limit or take control of elements of IRI's operations. As it faced increasing restrictions in Egypt in 2005, IRI relied on its deep ties with the NED and USAID to codify legal protections against foreign funding laws and managerial capture. Six years later, after Egyptian security forces raided their offices, IRI turned again to its government connections and secured protection and safe passage for its staff. It then used its flexible donors and its substantial income to quickly set up field offices in neighboring countries, continuing its work in Egypt from abroad, despite a negative public relations campaign designed to bolster popular support for SCAF. This rapid reaction was only possible because of IRI's immense flexibility—its deep pockets, powerful political allies, and worldwide network of field offices. Significant flexibility is thus critical for contentious organizations to effectively work in repressive autocracies, both in-country and from abroad.
