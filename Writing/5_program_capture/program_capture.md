Education, low contention organizations don't tend to worry about this as much - scope condition = high contention
They're mostly focused on just doing their mission - priority isn't taking on government, it's helping people

# Encouraging shifts in INGO missions through program capture

control and co-optation

TODO: A couple paragraphs outlining:

- Theoretical form of regulation (see capture part of @fig:theory-regulation-purpose): Host governments constrict the civil society regulatory environment in an effort to target INGO missions and capture the benefits from their work or coerce INGO missions to be more amenable to regime preferences
- Effects on INGOs: Laws lock INGOs into their programs, change their missions; make them pawns in greater political game within country
- Expected INGO reactions: When relationship is not contentious and/or when flexibility is limited, organizations will be more likely to align their missions with the government and explicitly shape their programs to match government objectives. When relationship is more contentious, organizations will act more strategically to protect against changes: choosing regulatory body, using more/fewer local/foreign staff, moving to a different country - fund irregularly, channel funds through domestic partners, work in exile, avoid fees
- Organizations with most resources and flexibility are best able to deal with changes



## Why capture programs?

Though fears of regime stability appear paramount in determining the relationship between INGOs and governments, the relationship between INGOs and their host governments is not always so antagonistic. Governments often take advantage of the foreign organizations working in their countries, using their presence and their services to boost their own public image at home and abroad. The presence of foreign organizations in failed states can signal growing stability and instill confidence in potential investors. For example, an education INGO working in East Africa reports:




TODO: Short ¶ outlining the rest of this section—governments attempt program capture with regulations related to oversight and operations.




Governments use legislation and regulations to control INGO funding. Resource-focused restrictions are as common as restrictions on registration—only a third of responding organizations report not feeling any effects of resource-related laws (see @fig:regs-faced-gatekeeping). By regulating and limiting access to funds, governments are able to directly target a crucial element of instrumental flexibility—a diversity of reliable revenue streams lends INGOs stability, and losing access to those streams can impose substantial burdens on organizations. At first glance, regulations aimed at limiting funding and resources appear to be related to gatekeeping, since controlling the revenue sources can reduce an organization's level of instrumental flexibility and can allow regimes to restrict INGO access to their countries. Importantly, however, government oversight over resources enables regimes to extract monetary benefits from guest INGOs and co-opt their activities for political gain. Attempts to co-opt or capture resources and revenue challenge core organizational values, and in their responses to these regulations, INGOs focus more on protecting their missions than on maintaining access to the country.

Governments can use regulations to directly capture resources by channelling money from INGOs into regime coffers. As one human rights organization in Central Africa notes, many restrictive states act as though "international [organizations] do not have the right to grant a certain amount of funds without passing through them,"[^12] and accordingly, states structure their regulatory environment in ways that encourage the capture of foreign money. According to survey respondents, strict laws related to resources—that notably need not be designed specifically with NGOs in mind—are the first step in a chain of events that allow restrictive governments to potentially seize resources and compromise organizational values. 


More prominent than these indirect types of resource-focused regulations, though, are laws limiting foreign funding for NGOs. Since the late 2000s, many countries have passed laws severely limiting or banning funding from foreign donors. This emphasis on foreign funding laws is warranted—as discussed above, registration laws can be benign and do not necessarily adversely affect INGOs, and restrictions on assembly and speech target a specific subset of advocacy- and politics-oriented INGOs that non-contentious NGOs. Foreign funding laws, on the other hand, explicitly limit foreign influence on domestic activities and cause direct harm to all international NGOs, which are internationally funded by definition. Perhaps more than any other factor, the international community's focus on a global crackdown on civil society gained prominence in response to laws that specifically targeted foreign funding and connections, including Russia's 2012 Foreign Agents law, China's 2017 Foreign NGO law, and Egypt's 2017 anti-NGO law. Foreign funding laws have an obvious gatekeeping function, and in previous chapters I showed that authoritarian regimes use them in concert with the de facto civil society regulatory environment to control which INGOs are allowed in the country. Organizations working in highly repressive regimes are often prohibited from contacting international organizations and can face "prosecution for receiving foreign aid and cooperation with international NGOs."[^17] Governments are also suspicious of foreign funding "in part because they know terror groups receive funding this way, but also because they look down upon any outside influences."[^18] @Chaudhry:2016, @DupuyRonPrakash:2015, and @DupuyRonPrakash:2016 find similar results: states overwhelmingly take political concerns into account when deciding to limit the activities of NGOs. 

In addition to their gatekeeping goals, foreign funding laws are also designed to co-opt NGO programs and capture NGO resources. Many governments create avenues—both legal and extralegal—for non-contentious organizations to receive foreign funds, but according to respondents, these roads allow the government to be "unjustly confiscatory"[^19] and can redirect funds from NGOs to the government. Transferring foreign funds to the government can happen at a formal, de jure level. Similar to the Russian Public Chamber system, which forces NGOs to channel all resources through a government agency, respondents note that working through India's Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) is the only way to legally obtain foreign money. The FCRA allows the government to dictate which organizations can receive money and gives it the ability to seize or freeze the assets of unwanted organizations, thus capturing NGO resources [@press-trust-india:2015].[^20] 

Transfers can also happen at an informal level. Respondents report that government officials in authoritarian regimes "solicit for opportunities to benefit unconditionally from international NGO resources";[^21] for many INGOs that rely on foreign funds, "either you give the government money or you are out."[^22] The inefficiencies imposed by resource-related laws lead to the second step in the process for capturing resources and compromising values: the temptation to turn to extralegal methods for avoiding delays. An INGO working in the Caribbean reports that "every regulation or law gives a potential pretext for an official or policeman to attempt to solicit a bribe."[^23] These bribes and side payments act as "speed money," [@Bardhan:1997, 1323] allowing organizations to dodge bureaucratic hurdles while simultaneously allowing regime officials to take foreign money. 

However, enriching repressive governments and using informal and illegal backchannels to avoid inefficiencies can challenge INGOs' core values. Several respondents reported that they resist efforts to co-opt their organizations through corruption and capture, but that the resistance hurts the effectiveness of their missions. For instance, a disaster relief INGO working in South Asia notes "[t]here is a lot of bureaucracy and corruption. We spend so much time to get approval in the projects[.] We don’t agree to pay bribe, which makes or work even more difficult [sic]"[^24]—the organization's reluctance to accede to overtures of corruption means that they are stuck with inefficiencies. An development INGO working in the Caribbean describes how avoiding contact with inefficient and expensive bureaucrats directly conflicts with their values:

> We are supposed to be signed up for [national social security], however all the workers want no part of it because they say that people pay in, but nobody can ever collect payment unless they are friends with a senator. We have not signed up, and are therefore out of compliance with the law. There is also … [national] employee medical [insurance]. If an employer pays into that, the employees have to go to [government] hospitals and can’t receive care otherwise. The closest hospital is 90 minutes away and has 1 doctor. The employees asked if they could please stick with the current system, which is simply that the organization directly manages care and pays all bills for work related injuries. *We are out of compliance, and in principle I don’t like being out of compliance.*[^25]

This organization's struggle to balance its preference to avoid government corruption and bottlenecks against its preference to comply with government regulations is emblematic of regimes' larger effort to encourage shifts in INGO missions through co-optation and control. Resource regulations purposely create inefficiencies to force INGOs to funnel additional money through their host governments, which in turn potentially distorts INGO values.


SO, what do they do?


1778; HQ: United Kingdom; target: Egypt, Arab Rep.; High contention
Each tranche of funds from overseas has to be approved or brought in irregularly.

1544; HQ: Netherlands; target: Egypt, Arab Rep.; High contention
We are not affected by these regulations because we fund through a intergovernmental organization in Egypt

1374; HQ: United States; target: Bangladesh; High contention
We are mainly impacted by regulations on funding, insofar as we seek to transfer funds to activists and other NGOs within the country. The government is suspicious of such transfers - in part because they know terror groups receive funding this way, but also because they look down upon any outside influences - and so this impacts how we make these transfers.


Reactions - why these?
1224; HQ: United States; target: Bangladesh; Low contention
Now we have more funds coming from Sweden and also Brazil

1343; HQ: India; target: Cambodia; Low contention
Started receiving funding from the Govt

1361; HQ: South Africa; target: Namibia; Low contention
we looked more within Namibia and less for funding support linked to foreign volunteer placement - responding to stricter visa and work permit legislation

1408; HQ: Switzerland; target: Australia; High contention
More individual donations, prompted by outrage at laws limiting our work

1437; HQ: Greece; target: Greece; Low contention
In response to lack of funding and in order to continue our projects. We have been seeking for volunteers who use EU or US grants in order to cover there living expencises to work with us.

## Managerial capture: regulating oversight

Governments are can be closely—and sometimes directly—involved in INGO programming, particularly in authoritarian contexts. The left panel of @fig:freq-both shows that organizations working in both types of regimes tend to be in fairly regular contact with the government, with the majority of INGOs meeting with officials at some level of government at least once a year. This diverges from how often INGOs claim to be required to submit formal reports to the government in the right panel of @fig:freq-both. The majority of organizations working in democracies—roughly 40% of all respondents—do not have any official reporting requirements, while a little over 15% of organizations working in democracies are required to report annually. In contrast, organizations that target autocracies are far less likely to not need to report, generally must check in at least annually with the government, and are more likely to need to report more than once a year. Autocracies thus have a heavier hand in INGO affairs, requiring more formal reporting and oversight than their democratic counterparts.

![Frequency of contact with government and formal reporting to government](../../Output/figures/3-freq-both){#fig:freq-both}


Regulations can give bureaucrats final say in INGO programming even without formal participation in governance. An advocacy organization working in West Africa must have its work checked and approved by the government and its programs are sometimes vetoed and "over powered,"[^30] while other organizations are required to get final ministry-level approval for their activities, programs, and publications.[^31] In other cases, regulations dictate that INGO programming falls under the direct supervision and control of local governments, leaving organizations with little flexibility in how they operate, essentially turning them into arms of the government—an organization working in West Africa had several of its programmatic themes subsumed by the government,[^32] with bureaucrats determining which activities the NGO should handle.  


1330; HQ: India; target: Egypt, Arab Rep.; Low contention
there are laws that we should have the Manager a local person. There is also a rule that if we want to have a foreign employee that we need to have 9 local employees

	the rules of to register as an International NGO are very restrictive and require a fully Indian board of directors, therefore we have opted for a liaison office, this kind of registration does not allow direct implementation of activities, for this reason we collaborate with Indian ngos

## Program capture: regulating operations

The legal environment dictates more than just the registration requirements for INGOs. Laws regarding NGO operations give governments control over some aspects of their advocacy and programming. This control is sometimes accidental and indirect. For instance, an orphanage working in Central Asia reports regularly getting locked into programs because of bureaucratic inefficiency. Their host country requires that all international NGOs dealing with orphans fully fund all children for a full calendar year. However, their donor sponsorship funds are collected irregularly and can sometimes disappear, leading to difficult financial decisions:




TODO: Evidence from the survey explaining reactions to operations regulations

Reactions to operations, based on flexibility + contentiousness

Coerced changes in programs because of government regulations are quite rare. 



Why do these guys change?
1428; HQ: France; target: Iran, Islamic Rep.; High contention
adjusting priorities and advocacy tactics depending on the changing regime in power, or new repressive laws being enacted, etc

1672; HQ: Nigeria; target: Ghana; Low contention
Largely dictated by legal, financial and operating regulatory oversight.

1458; HQ: Norway; target: Turkey; High contention
We are not allowed access to the areas where allegedly serious violations of human rights are taking place.




As far as i know, their relationship with our activities is more supportine than negative
As IDC receives no funding from the Australian government, this enables us to fully pursue our mission, and enjoy all legal avenues of freedom of speech. When sub-granting some aspects of our work to international partners, we are bound to comply with financial transfer and money laundering legislation.

# IRI

TODO: In the case of IRI and Index, though, governments aren't friendly - IRI used as signal of power to domestic audience; Index avoids resource capture

## Mission and strategy

## Sources of flexibility

## How it protects its core mission

make them pawns in greater political game within country - blatant show of force - TODO: how many other foreign NGOs were caught up in the raid? How many had cabinet-level connections to the Obama administration?

Similar to when HRW's Kenneth Roth, other activists turned away. [https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/12/egypt-consolidating-repression-under-al-sisi](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/01/12/egypt-consolidating-repression-under-al-sisi)

- Turn capture on head - adaptive management - try to induce government changes
- But also protect mission - Egypt closing, for example

# Index on Censorship

Avoids capture through funding mechanisms

## Mission and strategy

## Sources of flexibility

## How it protects its core mission

- Don't operate directly in countries, support local journalists only
- Chinese wall in funding, don't let mission get captured
