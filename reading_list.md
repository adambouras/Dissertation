**Important:** This list is still in its preliminary stages and may be excessively long (with 146 entries. Yikes!). However, I feel that it is a good foundation for the final list and can easily be culled and trimmed as I receive better suggestions from my committee.

Additionally, citations are very inconsistent and switch between APA and Chicago. Many of the items are saved to my bibliography manager, but many are also temporarily copied and pasted here from other bibliographies I and others have made. Once this is officially approved, I will add all citations to a BibTeX file for consistent and correctly formatted references.

----------

This reading list reflects my plan to (1) research the role of transnational and foreign-based advocacy and human rights NGOs (or civil society writ large) operating in authoritarian and hybrid regimes and (2) determine their effectiveness in influencing institutional reform. Given my regional expertise and the ongoing revolutionary upheaval, I plan on focusing the bulk of my research on regimes in the Middle East, but I also plan on comparatively testing my hypotheses on non-Middle Eastern regimes.

The theoretical foundation for my research combines disciplinary literature from political science and economics, in particular (1) institutional analysis, including works on new institutional economics, historical and constructivist institutionalism, and the relationship between institutions and governance; and (2) international relations, including works on the role of non-state actors in the international system. This reading list includes canonical books and articles on political institutions and civil society in international relations, as well as recent empirical work on the effects of global civil society on particular advocacy and human rights activities in non-democratic regimes (such as election monitoring, human rights shaming, and post-revolutionary advocacy).
