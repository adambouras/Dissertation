<div class="small"><strong>Abstract: </strong><em><p>International NGOs have long been instrumental in promoting universal human rights and providing humanitarian relief and assistance. However, the unique political dynamics of authoritarianism shape the programs, advocacy, and services that these INGOs provide in their target countries, potentially leading to changes in programming to accommodate the regulations and restrictions dictators impose on them. As they do with other pseudo-democratic institutions, authoritarian regimes use INGOs and their services for a variety of self-interested reasons, including enhancing their regime’s longevity and stability, boosting their international reputation, receiving policy guidance and assistance, or increasing their control over the population.</p>
<p>Because INGOs are based in foreign countries and are generally free to exit at will, dictators have a limited menu of policy options for controlling the international organizations that operate within their country. Regimes will constrict or expand regulations on INGOs based primarily on domestic political factors, but also in part based on the issues pursued by the INGOs. In turn, INGOs respond to dictators’ regulations in a variety of ways, ranging from compliance to outright antagonism. This response is determined in part by the amount of operational and organizational flexibility the INGO has, based on the INGO’s ideological leanings, the variety and the quantity of programs the INGO pursues in the country, and the strength of the connections the INGO and other organizations and states.</p></em></div>



<p>LDS Charities—the official humanitarian wing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)—has long struggled to obtain permission to legally provide its humanitarian services in countries ruled by dictators. The organization offers a variety of services, including neonatal resuscitation training, wheelchair delivery, eye exams, disaster relief, and direct assistance to local orphanages, leprosariums, and medical centers, but its legal status is often ambiguous. Beginning in the early 1990s, the LDS Church worked with Egypt’s now-former president Hosni Mubarak to allow LDS Charities to formally register as a foreign charity. Year after year, President Mubarak would signal his approval, with the caveat that his Coptic Christian council would ultimately have the final say. However, this council regularly denied all requests for legalization until finally conceding in 2007. Why did Mubarak, an ostensibly omnipotent dictator, defer to his Christian advisors? He had the legal right to approve the request on his own, and given that Egypt was not a democracy, there was arguably little need to show deference for such a small decision.</p>
<p>It is likely that Mubarak used LDS Charities and other humanitarian INGOs as pawns in domestic politics. Coptic Christians account for 10–15% of Egypt’s population and are both politically active and fearful of persecution. By giving Coptic leaders some say in trivial decisions, Mubarak could, in a way, placate them and help maintain the stability of his regime. Copts, in turn, appeared threatened by foreign Christian groups that could change the balance of Eastern Christian dominance in the country, and thus did not want more Western Christian organizations to work in the country. Though the foreign organizations requesting access dealt with innocuous issues that posed little threat to his regime, Mubarak benefitted from imposing restrictive regulations on certain types of INGOs. Additionally, once he gave formal legal permission, Mubarak benefitted from the services and assistance provided by these organizations. In each situation—INGOs allowed and disallowed—the dictator benefitted.</p>
<p>LDS Charities’ experience in working with dictators reflects a broader trend that in turn poses several interesting puzzles. Over the past decade, international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes as they respond to emergencies, assist with development, or advocate for human rights. However, these services and advocacy can challenge the regime—INGOs that provide essential services such as public health or education can undercut the regime’s role as a provider of public goods, and INGOs that advocate for human rights can challenge and embarrass regimes that regularly violate those rights. Despite these risks, the overwhelming majority of authoritarian countries continue to permit INGO activities (see Figure 2). Why do dictators allow INGOs to operate in their countries when the services and advocacy they provide can potentially undermine the stability of their regime? When do the benefits they gain from INGO services and advocacy outweigh the costs and risks? How do these regimes limit their exposure to the risks of INGOs?</p>
<p>For their part, why do INGOs work in dictatorships if their services and advocacy are ultimately used to help stabilize the regime? What do INGOs that work in dictatorships hope to accomplish? Additionally, what determines when INGOs adhere to authoritarian legal restrictions, oppose government intrusions into organizational practices, or pull out of the country entirely?</p>
<p>In my dissertation, I will argue that the dynamic relationship between autocrats and international NGOs leads to a state of <em>amicable contempt</em>, where each party is aware that the other might have ulterior motives. Authoritarian regimes will work to find the optimal level of INGO regulations—maximizing the benefits and minimizing the costs of INGO activities. Similarly, INGOs will work to find the optimal mix of programming within a country and either work within or push against the boundaries the regime has set. Both parties attempt to mutually benefit from the relationship—but is a mutual arrangement possible? Can both the regime and INGOs benefit, or will one party dominate?</p>
<p>In the remainder of this prospectus, I will outline how I will investigate these puzzles and answer these questions. After briefly reviewing the existing literature on authoritarian institutional balancing and INGO behavior, I lay out a broad theoretical framework with three connected hypotheses. I then describe the ensemble of empirical methods I will use to test and probe these hypotheses. I conclude with a general outline of the future dissertation and a tentative schedule of my research and writing plans.</p>
<h1 id="dictators-and-activists-reluctant-bedfellows">Dictators and activists: Reluctant bedfellows</h1>
<p>Recent work in political science and international relations has attempted to explain two significant puzzles: the internal workings of authoritarian politics and the international influence of non-state actors. Contrary to conventional wisdom, scholars such as <span class="citation">Blaydes (2011)</span>, <span class="citation">Levitsky and Way (2010)</span>, and <span class="citation">Gandhi and Przeworski (2007)</span> have argued that modern authoritarian regimes adopt quasi-democratic political institutions such as free elections, an independent judiciary, or civil society in ways that seem “wrong” to democratically minded Western observers. This research has shown that authoritarians delegate authority to these institutions in part to maintain their own power, offsetting domestic pressure and boosting their international reputation.</p>
<p>A separate literature has sought to open the black box of transnational civil society behavior, demonstrating that contrary to the popular idea that civil society can serve as the moral bulwark of the global system, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) are strategic actors that follow their own agendas. In particular, they are susceptible to a host of internal and external pressures and influences, including the institutional environments of countries they are based in <span class="citation">(Stroup 2012)</span>, the global demand for their advocated issue <span class="citation">(Bob 2002, 2005; Carpenter 2014)</span>, or their internal managerial structure <span class="citation">(Wong 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>However, little research has attempted to combine these two disparate theoretical developments and look the role of transnational civil society (and other non-state actors) <em>as an institutional actor within</em> authoritarian regimes. Why do self-interested autocrats allow INGOs to operate in their borders? How are INGOs influenced by pressures from authoritarian regimes they work with?</p>
<h2 id="authoritarian-institutional-balancing">Authoritarian institutional balancing</h2>
<p>A growing literature on the nuances of autocracy has begun to show that authoritarianism is not simply a transitional phase before democracy, but an altogether distinct regime type where autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power <span class="citation">(Levitsky and Way 2010)</span>, a phenomenon I will call <em>institutional balancing</em> (see Figure 1). This theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that authoritarians are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals <span class="citation">(Heiss 2012; Svolik 2009)</span>. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism is best viewed as a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other pseudo democratic institutional reforms <span class="citation">(Stacher 2012, 31)</span>.</p>

<img src="Figures/balancing.png" alt="Figure 1: Example of an authoritarian regime balancing multiple domestic and international institutional actors" />
<p class="caption">Figure 1: Example of an authoritarian regime balancing multiple domestic and international institutional actors</p>
</div>
<p>Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty <span class="citation">(Wintrobe 1990)</span>. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can establish narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage, or create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to create popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition <span class="citation">(Gandhi and Przeworski 2006, 2007; Kendall-Taylor and Frantz 2014)</span>. In either case, if “rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power” <span class="citation">(Gandhi and Przeworski 2007, 284)</span>. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals <span class="citation">(Brownlee 2007, 202)</span>, not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.</p>
<p>Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition <span class="citation">(Brumberg 2002)</span>. However, this dissonance creates an interesting (and potentially destabilizing) competitive dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government <span class="citation">(Frantz and Kendall-Taylor 2014)</span>. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents <span class="citation">(Levitsky and Way 2010)</span>. Political competition under authoritarianism is “real but unfair” <span class="citation">(Levitsky and Way 2010, 5)</span>—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.</p>
<h2 id="ingos-yet-another-actor-to-be-balanced">INGOs: yet another actor to be balanced</h2>
<p>Authoritarian institutional balancing is not limited solely to domestic institutions. States today confront a complex stew of domestic and international issues and actors, where activists, bureaucrats, legislators, judges, firms, civil society organizations, international organizations, media organizations, and foreign states interact and influence domestic policy and behavior <span class="citation">(Linos 2013; Slaughter 2004)</span>. INGOs can provide particularly acute pressure against authoritarian regimes, especially as they work in concert with domestic NGOs to pressure and shame states that behave poorly. Domestic NGOs that are restricted or blocked by their government will turn to allies in the international NGO community, who will in turn lobby their home states to convince international organizations like the UN to put high-level pressure on the offending regime, thereby creating an opening for the original domestic civil society organizations to advocate for policy changes. This relocation of advocacy power follows a boomerang pattern, moving from domestic NGOs to INGOs to foreign states and international organizations to domestic NGOs again <span class="citation">(Keck and Sikkink 1998)</span>.</p>
<p>With repeated boomerang-like pressure from domestic NGOs and INGOs, responses to individual issues can evolve into human rights norms, resulting in the institutionalization of new policies and practices within an offending state. <span class="citation">Risse and Sikkink (1999)</span> describe this process of norm socialization as a spiral, or a sequence of repeated boomerang effects. Domestic actors repeatedly turn to INGOs and transnational networks for help in their advocacy and slowly wear down the state. Initially the state denies the accusations of repression and claims that foreign human rights norms are invalid, but with repeated domestic and international pressure, the regime will begin to make concessions to the human rights network. Continued pressure helps formalize these concessions into actual legislation, and as politicians adhere to these policies (again because of domestic and international boomerang effects), they internalize the human rights norms that underpin the policies, thus resulting in long-lasting reform.</p>
<p>Relying on non-state actors as part of domestic institutional balancing is fraught with risk—INGOs are wildcards in authoritarian regimes <span class="citation">(DeMars 2005)</span>. INGOs have real effects on domestic politics and policies and pose significant risks to the regimes that allow them to operate. Countries that receive negative evaluations in human rights INGO reports and press releases see a marked reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows <span class="citation">(Barry, Clay, and Flynn 2013)</span> and tend to respond with better compliance to international human rights norms <span class="citation">(A. M. Murdie and Davis 2012)</span>. Close networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can even marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs <span class="citation">(Stiles 2002)</span>, while INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial “fiefdoms” and rival the central government in power and influence <span class="citation">(Schuller 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>Despite the risks of dealing with INGOs, authoritarians are increasingly opening up their countries to INGO advocacy and services. Figure 2 replicates work by <span class="citation">Kendall-Taylor and Frantz (2014)</span>, showing that a growing percentage of dictatorships now permits pseudo-democratic electoral institutions, such as party politics and competitive elections. In addition to these domestic institutions, the orange line—the percentage of dictatorships that have citizens who are members of more than 50 different INGOs<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>—shows that since the 1990s, international associational life has grown increasingly active in more and more authoritarian regimes.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Figure 2: Percent of dictatorships that allow domestic and international institutions</p>
</div>
<p>Sovereign nations engage with international organizations and transnational civil society selectively, depending on rational calculations of how that engagement might be beneficial to the regime. Authoritarian regimes in particular tend to follow international norms and allow INGO operations only when doing so “allows the regime to (1) shore up its authority and legitimacy and to (2) deflect international pressures” <span class="citation">(Hawkins 1997, 407–8, <em>numbers added</em>)</span>. Autocrats can use INGOs and other non-state actors to stabilize and reinforce their political power at home. For example, because competition for foreign patronage created an absence of strong links between Russian advocacy groups and the public, the Russian state has been able to restructure the civil society sector so that only NGOs that “work on issues that align with the national interest” receive funding and support <span class="citation">(Henderson 2010, 254)</span>, short-circuiting international spiral pressure and silencing domestic advocacy movements.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes will also use INGOs and other non-state actors to improve their international reputations. <span class="citation">Kelley (2012)</span> argues that because election monitoring has become a global norm, governments—even those who fully intend on cheating and manipulating the election—permit election monitoring INGOs as a way of appearing credible and democratic to peer nations. To ensure that monitoring efforts do indeed improve the regime’s reputation, authoritarian governments will try to circumvent international monitors or purposely invite friendly (or bribable) monitors to counterbalance more objective organizations. Because of this, election monitors can ultimately “contribute to the false legitimization of governments” <span class="citation">(Kelley 2012, 155)</span>.</p>
<p>These rational strategies have the potential to backfire, however, since authoritarians are rarely able to fully control all rival actors. Though inviting election monitors does provide substantial reputational benefits, the presence of high-quality monitors makes it more difficult to cheat and is associated with better election quality, fewer violations of electoral law, and more incumbent turnover <span class="citation">(Kelley 2012, 124)</span>—rulers in competitive authoritarian regimes can lose monitored elections. In post-revolutionary Egypt, international human rights monitoring organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have benefitted from increased operational latitude as the different regimes have sought to bolster their international reputation. With this greater flexibility, these organizations have been able to issue dozens of reports condemning the government for its human rights abuses. Increased transnational oversight into Egyptian human rights has inadvertently led to increased international shaming and condemnation.</p>
<h2 id="explaining-ingo-behavior">Explaining INGO behavior</h2>
<p>The boomerang and spiral models assume that INGOs will act as objective liaisons between domestic movements and international organizations or states. In their role as global moral police, INGOs should be able to address the most pressing and salient issues, providing any domestic opposition movement with the ability to access international assistance. Unfortunately this assumption is overly optimistic. Like any other institution, INGOs are strategic actors that pursue their own instrumental goals and agendas which are often at odds with the preferences of their home countries, international organizations, or the domestic NGOs they attempt to help <span class="citation">(Risse 2010, 284)</span>. Moreover, their decisions and behavior are influenced heavily by various (1) internal, (2), interactive, and (3) institutional factors</p>
<p>Internally, INGOs must balance their normative principles against the instrumental need of organizational survival. Unlike states or firms that generally face singular goals, like maximizing national security or maximizing profits, INGOs face a tradeoff between mission and money and must pursue both simultaneously—they must “instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments” <span class="citation">(Mitchell and Schmitz 2014, 489)</span>. When their environments are limited and restricted, INGOs face a strain on their stated mission, vision, and values.</p>
<p>The interactive relationships between INGOs also play a significant role in determining issue adoption. Organizations are most able to push new normative ideas onto the global agenda if they are connected to key nodes—or gatekeepers—in a network, who then vet the proposals and give (or deny) them credibility and legitimacy. In general, the more connected or centralized an INGO is in relation to other organizations, the more influential it will be <span class="citation">(Carpenter 2007, 2014)</span>. As such, domestic issues championed by INGOs in less influential network positions will likely fail to cause a boomerang effect.</p>
<p>Finally, beyond the influence of internal and interactive forces, an INGO’s willingness to pursue particular issues and agendas is shaped by institutional factors. Despite their global scope, INGOs are based within states and are affected by those states’ legal regulations, historical precedents, and cultural norms <span class="citation">(Stroup 2012)</span>. For example, CARE USA’s mission reflects American norms of efficiency and results-oriented pragmatism by using a professional staff, securing large amounts of government funding, and avoiding anti-American advocacy. In contrast, Amnesty International, based in the United Kingdom, eschews many of the stricter norms of business-like efficiency and professionalization to focus more on advocacy work. These different home-country institutional environments have a direct impact on which issues these INGOs will choose to adopt—NGOs in authoritarian regimes that are more compatible with the home-country norms of INGOs will be more likely to receive boomerang-like support.</p>
<h1 id="theoretical-argument">Theoretical argument</h1>
<p>Despite this rich and exciting literature on authoritarian institutional balancing, little existing research looks at how international actors (and in particular international NGOs) fit into a dictator’s stability-seeking calculus. Correspondingly, no research in the INGO studies field has looked at the effect of domestic authoritarian politics on INGO behavior. To remedy these deficiencies, I intend to address these two research questions throughout this project:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How do authoritarian regimes manage international NGOs that work in their countries?</li>
<li>How do international NGOs adjust their programming in response to the regulatory environment and domestic politics of the countries they target?</li>
</ol>
<p>I offer two related hypotheses to answer these questions, explaining (1) the formation and implementation of authoritarian INGO policies and (2) the selection of and changes to INGO programming in authoritarian regimes. These linked hypotheses can be stated as simple linked functions (below) and are shown in greater detail in Figure 3.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Regulatory environment for INGOs</strong> <em>{Tolerance, Constraint, Expulsion}</em> = regime stability + regime preferences for INGO issue</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>INGO response to regulatory environment</strong> <em>{Compliance, Mitigation, Antagonism}</em> (measured by divergence in ideal and actual programming) = regulatory environment + organizational flexibility</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Figures/theoretical_framework.png" alt="Figure 3: Theoretical framework" />
<p class="caption">Figure 3: Theoretical framework</p>
</div>
<p>Figure 4 demonstrates a mix of possible regulatory environments and INGO responses. I expect authoritarian regimes to set one of three broad policies towards international NGOs working in their regimes, each falling along a continuum of restrictiveness: (1) <em>tolerance</em>, or very few legal or actual restrictions on any activities, (2) <em>constraint</em>, or restrictions ranging from minor legal hurdles to major oppression or intimidation, and (3) <em>expulsion</em>, or the complete banning of all INGO activities. INGOs react to these policies with one of three general responses, each falling along a continuum of cooperation: (1) <em>compliance</em>, or tolerating and cooperating with the legal limits imposed by the regime, (2) <em>mitigation</em>, or creatively working around those policies to continue their work, and (3) <em>antagonism</em>, or ignoring and resisting those policies.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Figures/working_theory.png" alt="Figure 4: Possible authoritarian regulatory environments and corresponding INGO responses" />
<p class="caption">Figure 4: Possible authoritarian regulatory environments and corresponding INGO responses</p>
</div>
<p>As they stand now, these hypotheses are quite deductive, outlining a potential theory of regime and INGO behavior. As such, the hypotheses and implications are admittedly broad and potentially too simplistic. However, because the phenomena I intend on studying are so complex, I believe that my general arguments will allow me to usefully frame my empirical research without getting too bogged down in minutia.</p>
<p>At the same time, I fully expect to inductively discover more interesting trends as I collect and analyze data. For instance, it very well may be that my current categorization of flexibility does not map neatly in real life and that I will find other, more accurate, ways of predicting INGO programming and cooperation. Though I will not present these “found” trends as hypotheses (it would be unethical to retroactively reframe my existing hypotheses to match the data I find), my empirical analysis will likely be based around the patterns I induce from the data.</p>
<h2 id="hypotheses-and-testable-implications">Hypotheses and testable implications</h2>
<h3 id="authoritarian-regimes">Authoritarian regimes</h3>
<p>As described previously, the nature of authoritarian institutional meddling takes on many different forms and is done with different purposes. For example, dictators will co-opt legislatures to dole out the benefits of regime patronage to the elites and allow for better, more reliable monitoring of elite loyalty <span class="citation">(Blaydes 2011)</span>; capture or co-opt domestic civil society organizations to enhance service provision and citizen monitoring; or tacitly permit controlled popular protests to give citizens an outlet to vent their dissatisfaction with the government <span class="citation">(Chen 2012)</span> or signal state intentions during international negotiations <span class="citation">(Weiss 2013)</span>. Each of these pseudo-democratic domestic institutions (elections, civil society, state-sanctioned popular protests) enhance regime stability. I contend that, just as they do with other domestic actors and institutions, dictators must carefully balance and contend with international NGOs.</p>
<p>Key to harnessing this institutional dissonance for stability, however, is the autocrat’s ability to manage and control these external actors. When dealing with domestic challengers and institutions, dictators have a wide array of policy choices to manipulate and control their influence, ranging from formal legislation against certain activities to imprisoning and torturing recalcitrant legislators, judges, or activists. Autocrats have a more limited menu of policy options for controlling international actors, however, because of issues of sovereignty. While it maybe be easy to harass and imprison the family of a native activist, attempts to jail or torture international advocates or aid workers are far more risky, as foreigners often have the legal and political backing of their home states. While there are a few instances of authoritarian regimes attempting to formally prosecute foreigners (e.g. in 2013 an Egyptian court convicted 16 American NGO workers, and the government continues to detain reporters and cameramen from the Al Jazeera news network), dictators generally only have one type of policy lever to control INGOs: increasing or decreasing legal restrictions related to INGO advocacy and service provision.</p>
<p>I thus argue that the restrictiveness of an autocrat’s regulatory environment for international NGOs is directly related to the regime’s need for stability, resulting in my first hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong>: When authoritarian regimes perceive themselves to be more stable, the regulatory environment for international NGOs will be less restrictive (and vice versa—more unstable regimes will have more restrictive INGO regulations).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hypothesis leads to two testable implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formal <em>de jure</em> legislation regulating international civil society will be passed during times of instability.</li>
<li>The <em>de facto</em> application of the regulatory environment will be more restrictive and harsh during times of instability.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will argue that there are at least three observable and measurable sources of stability:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Domestic tensions</em>: factors that threaten a regime’s domestic stability, including the threat of competitive elections, relations between ethnic groups, opposition organizations gaining power relative to the regime, etc.</li>
<li><em>International reputation</em>: regimes often care about how they are perceived by major world powers and the international community<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>—a good international reputation can imply or display domestic stability.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Fear of contagion</em>: events in neighboring countries (such as the threat of revolution) can influence the stability of a regime—dictators will react to the instability of their neighbors to maintain their own domestic stability.</li>
</ol>
<p>The internal dynamics of an authoritarian regime define much of the regime’s response to and attitude towards international NGOs. However, the nature of the organizations that work in the country also influences the regime’s INGO policies. In particular, regimes will adjust the INGO regulatory environment based on the advocacy or services INGOs provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>H<sub>2</sub></strong>: When the issue area an INGO works with is more aligned with the preferences and needs of a regime, the <em>de facto</em> implementation of the regulatory environment for INGOs will be less restrictive (and vice versa—organizations working with more contentious issues will face stricter INGO applied regulations).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hypothesis implies that the <em>de facto</em> application of INGO legal restrictions will vary by the issue areas different INGOs pursue and the needs of the regime. For example, a regime that actively seeks out education INGOs in an effort to improve local education programming will be less restrictive with those organizations, while simultaneously acting more harshly against freedom of expression INGOs that advocate against the regime.</p>
<p>Both of these hypotheses are admittedly broad and potentially too generic. At first blush it seems obvious that unstable regimes will restrict INGO activity when it conflicts with their interests, while more stable regimes will strategically embrace INGO activity when it is advantageous to do so. However, the empirical application of these hypotheses is more nuanced, as a regime’s preferences for INGO services can enhance or decrease regime stability. For example, regimes can loosen up restrictions on international advocacy during times of instability—such as allowing international election monitors to observe contested elections <span class="citation">(Kelley 2012)</span>—in an effort to improve stability. Similarly, regimes can impose harsher restrictions on INGOs during times of political stability—though China is currently in the midst of an unprecedented expansion of civil society and has cooperated with dozens of international NGOs, the regime has shuttered several small INGOs that work with seemingly innocuous issues like advocacy for disabled people.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> These simple counterfactuals indicate that there is a sort of tipping point in the cost-benefit calculus for restricting INGOs. When will fewer restrictions lead to more regime stability, and conversely, when will a stable regime impose harsher restrictions?</p>
<p>Recent game theoretic research has attempted to address this question of the optimization of repression, finding that China permits or disallows anti-government investigative reporting based on the government’s current attitude to corruption and the current threat of revolution <span class="citation">(Lorentzen 2014)</span>, with equilibria that dynamically shift depending on the structure of a regime’s payoffs. I will argue that a regime’s optimization of INGO restrictions will follow a similar pattern. Though H<sub>1</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> are stated simply, the different components of stability and regime preferences will interact dynamically—for example, increased domestic instability might influence a regime’s desire to enhance international reputation, leading to a strategic decision to decrease INGO restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="international-ngos">International NGOs</h3>
<p>International and transnational NGOs do not operate in a vacuum. As described previously, INGOs are influenced by a host of factors beyond their stated mission vision, values, and strategies. In addition to these well established behavioral determinants, I argue that the regulatory environment for foreign-based advocacy and service provision in autocratic nations plays a significant role in shaping the behavior of international NGOs that work in those countries.</p>
<p>An INGO’s mission and menu of programs will often conflict with the preferences of the regime—for example, a freedom of expression INGO will likely pursue advocacy that is antagonistic towards Chinese speech, censorship, and media policy. Accordingly, an organization must decide how to adapt its programming to fit the requirements and needs of its host country. This decision can be difficult, pitting conflicting organizational values against each other. If the organization is too antagonistic or contentious, it runs the risk of expulsion, potentially leaving the INGO unable to continue its work in the country. However, if the organization is too cooperative, its programming may not be credible or effective as it kowtows to the dictator’s demands.</p>
<p>The degree to which an INGO is cooperative or antagonistic is most easily seen through its selection of programming, or the advocacy and services the organizations attempt to implement within the authoritarian country. The decision to antagonize or cooperate with the regime (and, in turn, adjust its programming) is largely a function of how much power and flexibility an INGO has in relation to the regime. I define flexibility as an INGO’s ability to minimize the distance between its <em>ideal</em> and its <em>actual</em> menu of programming within a given authoritarian regulatory environment. If an INGO is able to marshal resources, tweak its ideology, work with more partner organizations, or pursue other strategies to circumvent, mitigate, or otherwise reduce the impact of government regulations on their total menu of programming, the divergence between ideal and actual programming will be reduced, thus allowing the organization to autonomously pursue more antagonistic programming. If an INGO is inflexible, it will be more beholden to and restricted by the regulatory environment, leading to more cooperation with the regime. The relationship between flexibility, programming choice, and cooperation leads to my final hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>H<sub>3</sub></strong>: Under a moderately restrictive regulatory environment, when an international NGO has more flexibility in its provision of services or advocacy it will be more antagonistic and offer programs that contend against regime (and vice versa—organizations with less flexibility will be more cooperative with the regime).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hypothesis implies that an INGO’s <em>de facto</em> offering of programs within an authoritarian nation will diverge from its ideal menu of programming when it is less flexible in its response to the regulatory environment.</p>
<p>I will argue that there are several observable and measurable forms of organizational flexibility, each with different effects on an INGO’s response to regime regulations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Ideological flexibility</em>: an INGO is driven by its objective ideological principles (i.e. adherence to an overarching mission or vision statement), but is also constrained by the instrumental realities of implementation <span class="citation">(Mitchell and Schmitz 2014)</span>—an INGO’s strong ideology may limit its ability to respond to shifting regulations.</li>
<li><em>Programming flexibility</em>: an INGO that offers a diversity of programming in a country (or in neighboring countries) can shuffle resources between those programs, while an INGO that pursues a single program in a county will be more threatened by harsh regulations.<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Network flexibility</em>: an INGO that is linked to more powerful nodes in an issue area network can use those connections to increase their flexibility, while an INGO that is more isolated will have less external support against a restrictive legal environment (e.g. an education INGO with formal USAID support or an INGO that partners with Reports without Borders will have enhanced flexibility by nature of those relationships).</li>
<li><em>Flexibility in application of regulations</em>:<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> an INGO has the ability to circumvent or ignore regulations and exploit legal loopholes (e.g. an organization might be able to open a local branch under a different name, the government might be unable to enforce strict registration requirements, or a local executive director may have personal connections with mid-level bureaucrats who turn a blind eye to some programming).</li>
</ol>
<p>Flexibility does <em>not</em> explain the choice to cooperate with the regime under extreme forms of the regulatory environment. This is most easily seen in the corner cases of Figure 4. Organizations that do not diverge in their ideal and actual programming and that face no restrictions will naturally have more flexibility and autonomy, and based on the regime’s power relative to the INGOs, organizations will either (1) cooperate with the government, as in the case of Chinese consultative authoritarianism <span class="citation">(Teets 2014)</span>, or, (2) as in weak states like Haiti and Afghanistan, antagonize the government at will and operate beyond its regulations. Conversely, organizations that dramatically diverge from their ideal programming and face extreme restrictions (to the point of exclusion or expulsion) will naturally have limited operational flexibility and will either (1) be kicked out in spite of the benefits they offer the regime, as in the case of China’s ongoing shuttering of innocuous INGOs, or (2) be forced to antagonize the regime from abroad, as with Human Rights Watch and the Carter Center, which are both currently barred from Egypt.</p>
<p>The link between cooperation and flexibility is clearest (and most interesting) when applied to organizations that are in tension with the regime and face a moderately restrictive regulatory environment (the center column highlighted in grey in Figure 4). In this environment, organizations with lower levels of flexibility will struggle to maneuver and circumvent regime regulations, often leading to unwanted cooperation with the regime. For example, if a hypothetical INGO that teaches new media skills to state-employed reporters wants to teach skills that promote independent antagonistic reporting, but is unable to because it is unable to mitigate or challenge existing INGO regulations, it will necessarily cooperate with the regime. If that INGO had more flexibility, however, such as formal backing from the State Department, or other in-country programs it could shift its attention to, the divergence between its ideal and actual menu of programming would shrink and it could better challenge the regime.</p>
<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<p>Studying INGOs that work in authoritarian regimes poses a difficult methodological challenge. There is extensive cross-country research on domestic authoritarian institutions <span class="citation">(Frantz and Ezrow 2011; Frantz and Kendall-Taylor 2014; Kendall-Taylor and Frantz 2014)</span>, as well as detailed case studies of authoritarian regimes in general <span class="citation">(Levitsky and Way 2010)</span> and individual countries <span class="citation">(Blaydes 2011; Brownlee 2007; Chen 2012; Hildebrandt 2013; Teets 2014; Weiss 2013)</span>. However, beyond the excellent work by <span class="citation">Teets (2014)</span>, little research has looked at international institutions within authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>Studying INGOs is even more difficult, as there is almost no publicly available data. Existing research either relies on event data parsed from large corpora of news reports or highly specific in-depth case studies. Each of these approaches, however, pose methodological challenges. Event data often yields weak or uninteresting results since event data algorithms were originally developed to track wars and interactions between global elites—not NGOs—while case studies tend to be too focused on a handful of prominent organizations, resulting in findings and theories that are likely not very generalizable <span class="citation">(Bloodgood and Schmitz 2013; Mitchell and Schmitz 2014)</span>. For example, human rights INGO research has thus far been primarily concerned with Amnesty International and other similar organizations, such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), CARE International, or Oxfam <span class="citation">(Stroup 2012; Wong 2012)</span>. While there is utility in amassing thick descriptions of INGO activities, more must be done. Mitchell and Schmitz argue that INGO case studies need to be combined with large, more representative analyses to better understand the organizations that work on specific issue areas as a whole. <span class="citation">Kelley (2012)</span> and <span class="citation">B<span>ü</span>the and Mattli (2011)</span> do this well, looking at the election monitoring INGO sector and the world of standards setting as a whole while also including more detailed studies of selected cases from those sectors.</p>
<p>I plan to follow a similar approach and combine detailed descriptive case studies based on surveys, interviews, and archival research with broader, medium-<em>n</em> panel data for all authoritarian regimes worldwide. Once I have collected this data, I will use an integrated ensemble of methods to explore and test each of my three hypotheses at both a broader macro level (world- and sector-wide) and at a narrow micro level (two authoritarian nations and a randomly selected group of organizations). My general approach is summarized below in Table 1:</p>

<h2 id="testing-hypothesis-1-ingo-legislation-and-stability">Testing hypothesis 1: INGO legislation and stability</h2>
<p>I plan on first testing the relationship between regime stability and INGO restrictions using a medium-<em>n</em> cross national dataset of INGO restrictions that I will create based on a host of primary and secondary sources. This type of data collection process is not unprecedented—<span class="citation">Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash (2012)</span> provide a list of formal legal restrictions against foreign funding of domestic civil society organizations in 26 authoritarian states in Africa, and <span class="citation">Dupuy, Ron, and Prakash (2014)</span> use an expanded set of 45 countries to predict the conditions under which a country will adopt foreign funding restrictions. While the authors have not shared their final datasets, they do provide information about the nearly 20 different sources they used to identify and code funding restrictions, including reports from the International Center for Non-Profit Law, the US State Department, CIVICUS, the International Center for Civil Society Law, and others.</p>
<p>I intend to use this list of sources (and any other reports and legislation I can find) to create a more comprehensive set of formal legal restrictions on international NGOs in all authoritarian nations, including any type of law that contributes to the overall legal environment governing INGO behavior (i.e. not just restrictions on foreign funding flows). Figure 5 shows an example of what the ultimate dataset might look like.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Figures/sample_data.png" alt="Figure 5: Example of future de facto INGO restrictions dataset" />
<p class="caption">Figure 5: Example of future <em>de facto</em> INGO restrictions dataset</p>
</div>
<p>I will be able to combine this data with other existing data sources on regime stability—such as the International Country Risk Guide’s (ICRG) government stability measure<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> or the State Fragility Index<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a>—and build explanatory and predictive statistical models to test the association between stability and restriction.</p>
<p>At the micro level, I plan on further testing the relationship between different dimensions of regime stability and restrictiveness towards INGOs by carefully tracing the development of the INGO regulatory environment in my two primary country cases: Egypt and China (a full explanation of my case selection rationale and process is included in the next section). I will use legislative transcripts, local and international media, and interviews with activists (and hopefully/possibly government officials) to examine the domestic political environment that provided the background for the passage of different laws, explicitly linking legislation to incidents of instability, threats of revolution, fears of international contagion, or desires to increase international reputation.</p>
<h2 id="testing-hypothesis-2-ingo-legislation-and-regime-preferences">Testing hypothesis 2: INGO legislation and regime preferences</h2>
<p>To test the relationship between the <em>de facto</em> application of INGO restrictions and the regime’s policy preferences, I plan on detailing the experiences of INGOs working on two different issue areas—freedom of expression and education—in both Egypt and China (again, full justification for both the two countries and the two sectors follows in the next section). I will use local and international media archives, press releases, and official government and INGO reports to trace the relationship between the two sectors and the two governments. In particular, I will compare changes in the expected level of contentiousness of an issue—for example, China’s explosive economic growth in the late 2000s likely led to heightened interest in both education services and the appearance of expression rights, while Egypt’s 2011 uprising led to tentative expansions in expression rights, followed by harsh crackdowns—with changes in the <em>de facto</em> regulatory environment.</p>
<p>While I would like to create a comprehensive global dataset of the <em>de facto</em> application of INGO restrictions, doing so is unfortunately infeasible. As mentioned previously, event data tools can be powerful in some domains, but they are currently immature for INGO research. However, I am communicating with the developers of the most cutting edge event data service (the Phoenix Data Project<a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>, a project of the Open Event Data Alliance) to include a comprehensive list of INGO actors (explained below) in their algorithm. It is unlikely that I’ll have any useful data for this dissertation, but in the future, I will hopefully be able to get a good global picture of INGO restrictions.</p>
<h2 id="testing-hypothesis-3-ingo-responses-to-regulatory-environment">Testing hypothesis 3: INGO responses to regulatory environment</h2>
<p>As with my collection of data on regime restrictions on INGOs, I plan on collecting data on INGOs themselves at two levels. I will first create a comprehensive database of education and freedom of expression organizations in order to summarize the two sectors in general. I will scrape data from the Yearbook of International Organizations (YIO), which provides a wealth of information on INGOs, including the countries the organizations work in, staff sizes, budgets, formal connections to other organizations, and subject headings—usefully, the “Communications / Press” and “Education” subjects include hundreds of organizations. I will then feed the initial YIO list into IssueCrawler, a research tool that maps out connections between organizational websites to approximate a sort of sector-wide network structure and find other related organizations the YIO will have missed.</p>
<p>With these two complete databases, I will then be able to measure the distance between INGOs’ ideal and actual levels of programming in the countries they work in with sector-wide surveys .<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> I will poll these INGOs about their relationships with the government, their knowledge of the legal environment, their experiences with <em>de facto</em> restrictions, and their flexibility in ideology and programming.</p>
<p>At the micro level, I will use these databases to select a collection of organizations that I will look at in detail (see case study section below for my justification of organization selection). I plan to interview and survey staff, closely read annual reports and press releases, and (if possible) analyze financial records to determine the relationship between these INGOs’ flexibility and their programming response to the authoritarian regulatory environment. I will also be able to use the databases to sketch the networks of the sectors to determine if peer relationships influence these organizations’ choice of programming (for example, one very well connected organization may have more autonomy and flexibility because it collaborates directly with a central node organization in the education network).</p>
<h1 id="case-selection">Case selection</h1>
<p>As explained previously, my research will use detailed and multidimensional case studies to complement medium-<em>n</em> quantitative data. Specifically, I will carefully investigate several INGOs that pursue one of two policy issues (freedom of expression and education) in Egypt and China—two excellent cases of pseudo-competitive dictatorship. Figure 6 provides a graphical overview of my case selection.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Figures/case_selection.png" alt="Figure 6: Overview of case selection and research design" />
<p class="caption">Figure 6: Overview of case selection and research design</p>
</div>
<h2 id="countries">Countries</h2>
<p>Rather than study the effect of domestic politics on INGO policy in every known dictatorship, I plan to limit my case-based research to Egypt and China. I do so for several reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Both are highly salient cases, given the rapid growth of civil society in China and China’s prominent position in the global economy, and due to tumultuous post-revolutionary politics in Egypt.</li>
<li>Both are excellent examples of authoritarian institutional balancing, as each has devolved limited power to both domestic institutions and international NGOs in pursuit of stability.</li>
<li>There is intense scholarly debate over which countries qualify as “dictatorships,” with multiple competing definitions (such as Polity IV, Freedom House, etc.). I can circumvent this debate by selecting two cases that clearly fit the authoritarian mold.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="issue-areas">Issue areas</h2>
<p>My second hypothesis argues that authoritarian INGO policies are influenced by the alignment of the INGO sector’s programming with the regime’s preferences. Researchers commonly distinguish between INGOs that provide services—ensuring freedom from want—and advocacy—ensuring freedom from fear <span class="citation">(A. Murdie 2014; Stroup 2012)</span>. I believe this distinction also generally maps to regime preferences for an issue area. That is, an authoritarian regime will be more tolerant of INGOs that advocate and provide services that directly benefit the regime, and—conversely—less tolerant of those that threaten the regime.</p>
<p>In order to provide sufficient variation in my dependent variable and primary independent variables—or <em>de jure</em> and <em>de facto</em> regulations and changes in INGO programming—the issue areas I select must provide (1) heterogeneity in the types of programs and services organizations provide, (2) heterogeneity in the level of contentiousness with the ruling regime, and (3) theoretical leverage and generalizability. I argue that two prominent INGO sectors—freedom of expression and education—fulfill these requirements. Both issues are enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and theoretically have global support from UN-member countries (including most authoritarian nations). Each issue can also be classified as service provision (education) and advocacy (freedom of expression). Importantly, however, both issues can pose a potential threat to regimes—education and freedom of expression INGOs ostensibly try to shape how a regime <em>teaches</em> and <em>provides information</em> to its population. Figure 7 summarizes the predicted variation in these sectors’ contentiousness with the authoritarian regimes they work with.</p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<h3 id="education-ingos-eingos">Education INGOs (EINGOs)</h3>
<p>Despite its relative lack of attention in academic research, education has become a crucial pillar of the UN’s development program: Article 26 of the UDHR enshrines a universal right to education, and the second Millennium Development Goal (MDG) aims to achieve universal primary education worldwide. Developed states have led the Education for All (EFA) movement for decades, and tensions between national sovereignty and global oversight of education have been a useful case for studying issues of sovereignty in a globalized world <span class="citation">(Mundy 2010)</span>. Prior to the 1990s, UNESCO, the World Bank, UNICEF, and other formal intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) led the EFA movement and framed education as an issue of international development, which opened doors to millions of dollars in funding from USAID, DFID, and other state-based aid agencies.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1990s, however, in conjunction with the worldwide surge in transnational organizations, education INGOs (EINGOs) began to take the lead in EFA efforts, fueled by government grants and private donations <span class="citation">(B<span>ü</span>the, Major, and <span>de Mello e Souza</span> 2012; Mundy 2010)</span>. For example, a coalition of INGOs led by Oxfam International, ActionAid, and Education International created the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), which pressures states to adhere to the UDHR and MDGs and advocate for “the millions of adults and children who are denied their right to education.”<a href="#fn11" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> GCE partners with dozens of well known organizations, including CARE International, Save the Children, and Global March on Child Labor.</p>
<p>Though it is generally categorized as a development issue (and should thus probably be less contentious than traditional human rights advocacy), education provision and advocacy has significant variation in contentiousness, both in the conflict between state sovereignty and global governance (e.g. leaders often don’t want to outsource education provision to outsiders, even in the US), and in conflicting values—Chinese officials have been wary of US-based universities entering higher education<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>, and actors in states like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria have often been vehemently opposed to Western education in general.<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> EINGOs are highly entangled in domestic debates over education policy and thus fertile ground for shifting regulations.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-of-expression-ingos-feingos">Freedom of expression INGOs (FEINGOs)</h3>
<p>Like the EFA movement, the freedom of expression movement is based on the UN’s UDHR. Article 19 declares that “[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” Since the signing of the UDHR, hundreds of freedom of expression INGOs (FEINGOs) have been formed to advocate for and provide enhanced services for this universal right. Some organizations, such as Article19, Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the International Press Institute work with regimes to promote policy reforms related to media regulation, censorship, defamation, and intellectual property (among others) and create global indices of censorship and press freedom. Some of these organizations are involved in actual litigation, but others attempt to work with authoritarian regimes to propose and enact reforms.</p>
<p>Some organizations also provide more tangible services. For example, International Media Support provides training to journalist unions, associations, and press councils and gives technical training on media business development to independent (and pseudo-independent) media outlets in authoritarian regimes in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. BBC Media Action, the BBC’s formal charitable foundation, provides similar services by training local media organizations around the world in news production.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes have a proven history of strategically using foreign private actors to control and limit freedom of expression rights in their countries, despite the good intentions of actors in this issue area. For example, as a precondition to enter the huge Chinese market, Google, Microsoft, and Apple have all had to make freedom of expression concessions to the Chinese government, removing references to Tiananmen Square and other controversial topics—self-censorship that has angered many in the United States. Other private US- and UK-based firms sell IT security software help Middle Eastern governments surveil and censor activists and limit public consumption of information.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Recent research shows that authoritarian regimes have purposely turned to FEINGOs to better control information. Despite the near-utopian optimistic view that the internet would allow activists and journalists to circumvent surveillance and overthrow dictatorships, governments have become quite tech savvy: “Many [governments] went from spectators in the digital revolution to sophisticated early adopters of advanced technologies that allowed them to monitor content, activists, and journalists, and direct the flow of information” <span class="citation">(Bennett and Naim 2015)</span>. Because direct censorship of the media and press is costly, authoritarian regimes have increasingly turned to a strategy of “stealth censorship,” creating pseudo private firms and government-operated NGOs (GONGOs) that appear to be members of civil society that care about freedom of expression, but are really just government agencies.</p>
<p>The fact that authoritarian regimes are beginning to use traditional institutions that enshrine freedom of expression—such as an independent press and the internet—to increase their own stability provides variation in regime response to these INGOs. Despite their intentions of advocating for a free press and for expression rights, FEINGOs are entangled in domestic authoritarian politics.</p>
<h2 id="organizations">Organizations</h2>
<p>Having narrowed down my cases to EINGOs and FEINGOs that work in Egypt and China, I must still decide how many and which specific organizations to look at in detail. To provide some leverage and external generalizability to my case research, I plan on selecting a (mostly) random mix of organizations from the complete sector-wide databases (see Table 2). I will select at least one large or prominent INGO from each sector that works in both Egypt and China (likely not selected at random) to compare the differences in programming across the countries, in addition to several INGOs (selected at random) that do not necessarily work in both countries.</p>

<p>Ultimately, many of my empirical findings will hinge on the organizations I select. To check for external validity, I will conclude by briefly testing my findings on another set of INGOs—either the top <em>n</em> NGOs in the sector or selected at random.</p>
