<h1 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h1>
<p>International NGOs have long been active in promoting universal human rights such as education and freedom of expression. However, the unique political dynamics of authoritarianism shape the programs, advocacy, and services that these INGOs provide in their target countries, potentially leading to changes in programming to accommodate the regulations and restrictions dictators impose on them in an effort to secure regime stability. As they do with other pseudo-democratic institutions, dictators use INGOs and their services for a variety of self-interested reasons, including enhancing their regime’s longevity and stability, boosting their international reputation, receiving policy guidance and assistance, or increasing their control over the population.</p>
<p>Because INGOs are based in foreign countries and are generally free to exit at will, dictators have a limited menu of policy options for controlling the international organizations that operate within their country. Regimes will constrict or expand regulations on INGOs based primarily on domestic political factors, but also in part based on the issues pursued by the INGOs. In turn, INGOs respond to dictators’ regulations in a variety of ways, ranging from compliance to outright antagonism. This response is determined in part by the variety and the quantity of programs the INGO pursues in the country, the number of donors funding the INGO, and the strength of the connections between international and native staff.</p>

<h1 id="theoretical-argument">Theoretical argument</h1>
<p>Despite the rich and exciting literature on authoritarian institutional balancing, little existing research looks at how international actors (and in particular international NGOs) fit into a dictator’s stability-seeking calculus. Correspondingly, no research in the INGO studies field has looked at the effect of domestic authoritarian politics on INGO behavior. To remedy these deficiencies, I intend to address these two research questions throughout this project:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How do authoritarian regimes manage international NGOs that work in their countries?</li>
<li>How do international NGOs adjust their programming in response to the regulatory environment and domestic politics of the countries they target?</li>
</ol>
<p>I offer two related hypotheses to answer these questions, explaining (1) the formation and implementation of authoritarian INGO policies and (2) the selection of and changes to INGO programming in authoritarian regimes. These linked hypotheses can be stated as simple functions (below) and are shown in greater detail in Figure 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Regulatory environment for INGOs</strong> = regime stability + regime preferences for INGO issue</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>INGO response to regulatory environment</strong> (as measured by INGO programming) = <em>regulatory environment</em> + principled concerns + instrumental concerns + links with other INGOs</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="caption">Figure 1: Theoretical framework</p>
</div>
<p>Figure 2 demonstrates a mix of possible regulatory environments and INGO responses. I expect authoritarian regimes to set one of three broad policies towards international NGOs working in their regimes, each falling along a continuum of restrictiveness: (1) <em>tolerance</em>, or very few legal or actual restrictions on any activities, (2) <em>constraint</em>, or restrictions ranging from minor legal hurdles to major oppression or intimidation, and (3) <em>expulsion</em>, or the complete banning of all INGO activities. INGOs react with one of three general responses, each falling along a continuum of cooperation: (1) <em>compliance</em>, or tolerating and cooperating with the legal limits imposed by the regime, (2) <em>mitigation</em>, or creatively working around those policies to continue their work, and (3) <em>antagonism</em>, or ignoring and resisting those policies. Under compliance and mitigation, I expect INGOs to make adjustments to their programming to remain within the legal bounds set by the regime, while under antagonism, there will be no little to no changes in programming or strategy.</p>

<h2 id="hypotheses-and-testable-implications">Hypotheses and testable implications</h2>
<h3 id="authoritarian-regimes">Authoritarian regimes</h3>
<p>As described previously, the nature of authoritarian institutional meddling takes on many different forms and is done with different purposes. For example, dictators will co-opt legislatures to dole out the benefits of regime patronage to the elites and allow for better, more reliable monitoring of elite loyalty <span class="citation">(Blaydes 2011)</span>; capture or co-opt domestic civil society organizations to enhance service provision and citizen monitoring; or tacitly permit controlled popular protests to give citizens an outlet to vent their dissatisfaction with the government <span class="citation">(Chen 2012)</span> or signal state intentions during international negotiations <span class="citation">(Weiss 2013)</span>. Each of these pseudo-democratic domestic institutions (elections, civil society, state-sanctioned popular protests) enhance regime stability. I contend that, just as they do with other domestic actors and institutions, dictators use international NGOs in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Key to harnessing this institutional dissonance for stability, however, is the autocrat’s ability to manage and control these external actors. When dealing with domestic challengers and institutions, dictators have a wide array of policy choices to manipulate and control their influence, ranging from formal legislation against certain activities to imprisoning and torturing recalcitrant legislators, judges, or activists. Autocrats have a more limited menu of policy options for controlling international actors, however, because of issues of sovereignty. While it maybe be easy to harass and imprison the family of a native activist, attempts to jail or torture international advocates or aid workers are far more risky, as foreigners often have the legal and political backing of their home states. While there are a few instances of authoritarian regimes attempting to formally prosecute foreigners (e.g. in 2013 an Egyptian court convicted 16 American NGO workers, and the government continues to detain reporters and cameramen from the Al Jazeera news network), dictators generally only have one type of policy lever to control INGOs: increasing or decreasing legal restrictions related to INGO advocacy and service provision.</p>
<p>I thus argue that the restrictiveness of an autocrat’s regulatory environment for international NGOs is directly related to the regime’s need for stability, resulting in my first hypothesis:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong>: When authoritarian regimes perceive themselves to be more stable, the regulatory environment for international NGOs will be less restrictive (and vice versa—more unstable regimes will have more restrictive INGO regulations).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hypothesis leads to two testable implications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formal <em>de jure</em> legislation regulating international civil society will be passed during times of instability.</li>
<li>The <em>de facto</em> application of the regulatory environment will be more restrictive and harsh during times of instability.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will argue that there are at least three observable and measurable sources of stability:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Domestic tensions</em>: factors that threaten a regime’s domestic stability, including the threat of competitive elections, relations between ethnic groups, opposition organizations gaining power relative to the regime, etc.</li>
<li><em>International reputation</em>: regimes often care about how they are perceived by major world powers and the international community<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>—a good international reputation can imply or display domestic stability.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Fear of contagion</em>: events in neighboring countries (such as the threat of revolution) can influence the stability of a regime—dictators will react to the instability of their neighbors to maintain their own domestic stability.</li>
</ol>
<p>The internal dynamics of an authoritarian regime define much of the regime’s response to and attitude towards international NGOs. However, the nature of the organizations that work in the country also influences the regime’s INGO policies. In particular, regimes will adjust the INGO regulatory environment based on the advocacy or services INGOs provide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>H<sub>2</sub></strong>: When the issue area an INGO works with is more aligned with the preferences and needs of a regime, the <em>de facto</em> implementation of the regulatory environment for INGOs will be less restrictive (and vice versa—organizations working with more contentious issues will face stricter INGO applied regulations).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This hypothesis implies that the <em>de facto</em> application of INGO legal restrictions will vary by the issue areas different INGOs pursue and the needs of the regime. For example, a regime might actively seek out education INGOs in an effort to improve local education programming will be less restrictive with those organizations, while simultaneously acting more harshly against freedom of expression INGOs that advocate against the regime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Problematize hypotheses - sometimes regimes will hit a tipping point where restrictions won’t work anymore - Work up the fact that H1 isn’t totally obvious - it might be smarter for an authoritarian government to loosen up when unstable, like when governments open up pseudo democratically - also, H3: non-regime-aligned NGOs are less likely to X</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="international-ngos">International NGOs</h3>
<p>International and transnational NGOs do not operate in a vacuum. As described above, INGOs are influenced by a host of factors beyond their stated mission vision, values, and strategies, including the networks they work within <span class="citation">(Carpenter 2014)</span>, their internal organizational and managerial structure <span class="citation">(Wong 2012)</span>, and the regulatory environment and philanthropic norms of their home countries <span class="citation">(Stroup 2012)</span>. In addition to these well established behavioral determinants, I will argue that the regulatory environment for foreign-based advocacy and service provision in autocratic nations plays a significant role in shaping the behavior of international NGOs that work in those countries.</p>
<p>An INGO’s mission and menu of programs will often conflict with the preferences of the regime—for example, a freedom of expression INGO will likely pursue advocacy that is antagonistic towards Chinese speech, censorship, and media policy. Accordingly, an organization must decide how to adapt its programming to fit the requirements and needs of its host country. This decision can be difficult, pitting conflicting organizational values against each other: if the organization is too antagonizing and too contentious, it runs the risk of expulsion, potentially leaving the INGO unable to continue its work in the country, but if the organization is too cooperative, though, its programming may not be credible or effective as it kowtows to the dictator’s demands. An INGO’s decision to cooperate or antagonize the regime (and, in turn, adjust its programming) is largely a function of how much flexibility the INGO has:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>H<sub>3</sub></strong>: When an international NGO has more flexibility in its provision of services or advocacy, it will be more antagonistic and offer programs that contend against the regulatory environment (and vice versa—organizations with less flexibility will be more cooperative with the regime).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The degree to which an INGO is cooperative or antagonistic is most easily seen through its selection of programming—the advocacy and services the organizations attempts to implement within the authoritarian country. This hypothesis implies that an INGO’s <em>de facto</em> offering of programs within an authoritarian nation will diverge from its ideal menu of programming when it is less flexible in its response to the regulatory environment.</p>
<p>I will argue that there are several types of organizational flexibility that directly affect an INGO’s response to regime regulations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Ideological flexibility</em>: an INGO is driven by its objective ideological principles (i.e. adherence to an overarching mission or vision statement), but are also constrained by the instrumental realities of implementation <span class="citation">(Mitchell and Schmitz 2014)</span>—an INGO’s strong ideology may limit its ability to respond to shifting regulations.</li>
<li><em>Programming flexibility</em>: an INGO that offers a diversity of programming in a country (or in neighboring countries) can shuffle resources between those programs, while an INGO that pursues a single program in a county will be more threatened by harsh regulations.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Network flexibility</em>: an INGO that is strongly embedded in an issue area network can more easily rely on other organizations for protection from regulations or outsource its programming goals (e.g. an organization might pass off its more contentious programming to a larger organization with more power or clout).</li>
<li><em>Flexibility in application of regulations</em>: an INGO has the ability to circumvent or ignore regulations and exploit legal loopholes (e.g. an organization might be able to open a local branch under a different name, the government might be unable to enforce strict registration requirements, or a local executive director may have personal connections with mid-level bureaucrats who turn a blind eye to some programming).</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="case-selection">Case selection</h1>
<p>In order to empirically (1) link authoritarian INGO policy to domestic political trends and (2) observe changes in INGO cooperation and programming as a result of those policies, I will use detailed and multidimensional case studies. More specifically, I will select several INGOs that pursue one of two policy issues (freedom of expression and education) in Egypt and China—two excellent cases of pseudo-competitive dictatorship. Figure 3 provides a graphical overview of my case selection.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Figures/case_selection.png" alt="Figure 3: Overview of case selection and research design" />
<p class="caption">Figure 3: Overview of case selection and research design</p>
</div>
<h2 id="countries">Countries</h2>
<p>Rather than study the effect of domestic politics on INGO policy in every known dictatorship, I plan to limit my research to Egypt and China. I do so for several reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Both are highly salient cases, given the rapid growth of civil society in China and China’s prominent position in the global economy, and due to tumultuous post-revolutionary politics in Egypt.</li>
<li>Both are excellent examples of authoritarian institutional balancing, as each has devolved limited power to both domestic institutions and international NGOs in pursuit of stability.</li>
<li>There is very little data on NGO or INGO restrictions in any authoritarian regime. As such, I plan on tracing the histories of NGO legislation in both countries and explicitly linking them to domestic trends that could potentially threaten the regime. I would rather have deep coverage of INGO policy in a handful of cases than superficial coverage of every dictatorships’ policies.</li>
<li>There is intense scholarly debate over which countries qualify as “dictatorships,” with multiple competing definitions (such as Polity IV, Freedom House, etc.). I can avoid this debate by selecting two cases that clearly fit the authoritarian mold.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="issue-areas">Issue areas</h2>
<p>A key element of my first hypothesis is that authoritarian INGO policies are influenced in part by the alignment of the INGO sector’s programming with the regime’s preferences. That is, an authoritarian regime will be more tolerant of INGOs that advocate and provide services that directly benefit the regime, and—conversely—less tolerant of those that threaten the regime.</p>
<p><strong>ADD ¶ on service provision vs. advocacy</strong> - Stroup:2012 and Murdie:2014</p>
<p>In order to provide enough variation in regime reactions and in INGO programming, the issue areas I select must provide (1) heterogeneity in the types of programs and services organizations provide, (2) heterogeneity in the level of contentiousness with the ruling regime, and (3) theoretical leverage and generalizability. I believe that two prominent INGO sectors—freedom of expression and education—fulfill these requirements. Both issues are enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and theoretically have global support from UN-member countries (including most authoritarian nations). However, both issues also pose a potential threat to regimes—education and freedom of expression INGOs ostensibly try to shape how a regime <em>teaches</em> and <em>provides information</em> to its population. Figure 4 summarizes the variation in these sectors’ contentiousness with the authoritarian regimes they work with.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="education-ingos-eingos">Education INGOs (EINGOs)</h3>
<p>Despite its relative lack of attention in academic research, education has become a crucial pillar of the UN’s development program: Article 26 of the UDHR enshrines a universal right to education, and the second Millennium Development Goal (MDG) aims to achieve universal primary education worldwide. Developed states have led the Education for All (EFA) movement for decades, and tensions between national sovereignty and global oversight of education have been a useful case for studying issues of sovereignty in a globalized world <span class="citation">(Mundy 2010)</span>. Prior to the 1990s, UNESCO, the World Bank, UNICEF, and other formal intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) led the EFA movement and framed education as an issue of international development, which opened doors to millions of dollars in funding from USAID, DFID, and other state-based aid agencies.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1990s, however, in conjunction with the worldwide surge in transnational organizations, education INGOs (EINGOs) began to take the lead in EFA efforts, fueled by government grants and private donations <span class="citation">(B<span>ü</span>the, Major, and <span>de Mello e Souza</span> 2012; Mundy 2010)</span>. For example, a coalition of INGOs led by Oxfam International, ActionAid, and Education International created the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), which pressures states to adhere to the UDHR and MDGs and advocate for “the millions of adults and children who are denied their right to education.”<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> GCE partners with dozens of well known organizations, including CARE International, Save the Children, and Global March on Child Labor.</p>
<p>Though it is generally categorized as a development issue (and should thus probably be less contentious than traditional human rights advocacy), education provision and advocacy has significant variation in contentiousness, both in the conflict between state sovereignty and global governance (e.g. leaders often don’t want to outsource education provision to outsiders, even in the US), and in conflicting values—Chinese officials have been wary of US-based universities entering higher education<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>, and actors in states like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria have often been vehemently opposed to Western education in general.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="freedom-of-expression-ingos-feingos">Freedom of expression INGOs (FEINGOs)</h3>
<p>Like the EFA movement, the freedom of expression movement is based on the UN’s UDHR. Article 19 declares that “[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.” Since the signing of the UDHR, hundreds of freedom of expression INGOs (FEINGOs) have been formed to advocate for and provide enhanced services for this universal right. Some organizations, such as Article19, Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the International Press Institute work with regimes to promote policy reforms related to media regulation, censorship, defamation, and intellectual property (among others) and create global indices of censorship and press freedom. Some of these organizations are involved in actual litigation, but others attempt to work with authoritarian regimes to propose and enact reforms.</p>
<p>Some organizations also provide more tangible services. For example, International Media Support provides training to journalist unions, associations, and press councils and gives technical training on media business development to independent (and pseudo-independent) media outlets in authoritarian regimes in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. BBC Media Action, the BBC’s formal charitable foundation, provides similar services by training local media organizations around the world in news production.</p>
<p>Authoritarian regimes have a proven history of strategically using foreign private actors to control and limit freedom of expression rights in their countries, despite the good intentions of actors in this issue area. For example, as a precondition to enter the huge Chinese market, Google, Microsoft, and Apple have all had to make freedom of expression concessions to the Chinese government, removing references to Tiananmen Square and other controversial topics—self-censorship that has angered many in the United States. Other private US- and UK-based firms sell IT security software help Middle Eastern surveil and censor activists and limit public consumption of information.<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Recent research shows that authoritarian regimes have purposely turned to FEINGOs to better control information. Despite the near-utopian optimistic view that the internet would allow activists and journalists to circumvent surveillance and overthrow dictatorships, governments have become quite tech savvy: “Many [governments] went from spectators in the digital revolution to sophisticated early adopters of advanced technologies that allowed them to monitor content, activists, and journalists, and direct the flow of information” <span class="citation">(Bennett and Naim 2015)</span>. Because direct censorship of the media and press is costly, authoritarian regimes have increasingly turned to a strategy of “stealth censorship,” creating pseudo private firms and government-operated NGOs (GONGOs) that appear to be members of civil society that care about freedom of expression, but are really just government agencies.</p>
<p>The fact that authoritarian regimes are beginning to use traditional institutions that enshrine freedom of expression—such as an independent press and the internet—to increase their own stability provides variation in regime response to these INGOs. Despite their intentions of advocating for a free press and for expression rights, FEINGOs are entangled in domestic authoritarian politics.</p>

<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>
<p>Studying INGOs that work in authoritarian regimes poses a difficult methodological challenge. There is extensive cross-country research on domestic authoritarian institutions <span class="citation">(Frantz and Ezrow 2011; Frantz and Kendall-Taylor 2014; Kendall-Taylor and Frantz 2014)</span>, as well as detailed case studies of authoritarian regimes in general <span class="citation">(Levitsky and Way 2010)</span> and China and Egypt specifically <span class="citation">(Blaydes 2011; Chen 2012; Hildebrandt 2013; Teets 2014; Weiss 2013)</span>. However, beyond the excellent work by <span class="citation">Teets (2014)</span>, little research has looked at international institutions within authoritarian regimes.</p>
<p>Studying INGOs is even more difficult, as there is almost no publicly available data. Existing research either relies on highly specific in-depth case studies <span class="citation">(Mitchell and Schmitz 2014; Stroup 2012; Wong 2012)</span> or event data parsed from large corpora of news reports <span class="citation">(Murdie 2014)</span>, though this latter source often yields weak and uninteresting results.</p>
