Hypothesis,Level,Data,Approach
H~1~: Regime stability and INGO regulatory environment,Macro,"Database of INGO regulations, collected and coded by me.",Correlate restrictions with existing country-level data on stability and authoritarian institutionalization using regression and other statistical methods.
&nbsp;,Micro,"Legislative transcripts, news reports, interviews","Trace the historical legislative process behind INGO regulations in China and Egypt, linking developments to incidents and trends of instability, threat, or change."
H~2~: Regime preferences for the INGO issue,Macro,(event data not sufficient),(difficult to measure preferences and application of legislation across all dictatorships)
&nbsp;,Micro,"Newspaper archives, media reports, international activist and government reports","Trace how formal legislation is actually applied to all international NGOs working in China and Egypt and compare if application is stricter because of the contentiousness of the issue areas the INGOs deal with. In particular, trace changes in the expected contentiousness of an issue (e.g. freedom of expression issues became more salient in post-revolutionary Egypt)."
H~3~: INGO response to authoritarian regulatory environment,Macro,"(1) Database of complete freedom of expression and education INGO sectors, collected by parsing existing data sources (like the Yearbook of International Organizations) and programmatically trawling the internet. (2) Sector-wide surveys about experiences in authoritarian regimes.","(1) Analyze the shape, density, and size of each sector network to determine the influence of peer relationships on organizational flexibility. (2) Summarize and correlate survey responses and analyze open ended survey questions."
&nbsp;,Micro,"Interviews and more detailed surveys of randomly selected organizations that work specifically in Egypt and China; annual reports, statements, press releases, etc.",Determine the level of divergence between the INGO's ideal programming and actual programming and correlate that divergence with the severity of the regulatory environment. Examine the influence of different types of flexibility on the menu of programs the INGO offers.
