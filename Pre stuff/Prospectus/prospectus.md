LDS Charities—the official humanitarian wing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)—has long struggled to obtain permission to legally provide its humanitarian services in countries ruled by dictators. The organization offers a variety of services, including neonatal resuscitation training, wheelchair delivery, eye exams, disaster relief, and direct assistance to local orphanages, leprosariums, and medical centers, but its legal status is often ambiguous. Beginning in the early 1990s, the LDS Church worked with Egypt's now-former president Hosni Mubarak to allow LDS Charities to formally register as a foreign charity. Year after year, President Mubarak would signal his approval, with the caveat that his Coptic Christian council would ultimately have the final say. However, this council regularly denied all requests for legalization until finally conceding in 2007. Why did Mubarak, an ostensibly omnipotent dictator, defer to his Christian advisors? He had the legal right to approve the request on his own, and given that Egypt was not a democracy, there was arguably little need to show deference for such a small decision.

It is likely that Mubarak used LDS Charities and other humanitarian INGOs as pawns in domestic politics. Coptic Christians account for 10–15% of Egypt's population and are both politically active and fearful of persecution. By giving Coptic leaders some say in trivial decisions, Mubarak could, in a way, placate them and help maintain the stability of his regime. Copts, in turn, appeared threatened by foreign Christian groups that could change the balance of Eastern Christian dominance in the country, and thus did not want more Western Christian organizations to work in the country. Though the foreign organizations requesting access dealt with innocuous issues that posed little threat to his regime, Mubarak benefitted from imposing restrictive regulations on certain types of INGOs. Additionally, once he gave formal legal permission, Mubarak benefitted from the services and assistance provided by these organizations. In each situation—INGOs allowed and disallowed—the dictator benefitted.

LDS Charities' experience in working with dictators reflects a broader trend that in turn poses several interesting puzzles. Over the past decade, international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes as they respond to emergencies, assist with development, or advocate for human rights. However, these services and advocacy can challenge the regime—INGOs that provide essential services such as public health or education can undercut the regime's role as a provider of public goods, and INGOs that advocate for human rights can challenge and embarrass regimes that regularly violate those rights. Despite these risks, the overwhelming majority of authoritarian countries continue to permit INGO activities (see [@fig:ingos_dictatorships] below). Why do dictators allow INGOs to operate in their countries when the services and advocacy they provide can potentially undermine the stability of their regime? When do the benefits they gain from INGO services and advocacy outweigh the costs and risks? How do these regimes limit their exposure to the risks of INGOs?

For their part, why do INGOs work in dictatorships if their services and advocacy are ultimately used to help stabilize the regime? What do INGOs that work in dictatorships hope to accomplish? Additionally, what determines when INGOs adhere to authoritarian legal restrictions, oppose government intrusions into organizational practices, or pull out of the country entirely?

In my dissertation, I will argue that the dynamic relationship between autocrats and international NGOs leads to a state of *amicable contempt*, where each party is aware that the other might have ulterior motives. Authoritarian regimes will work to find the optimal level of INGO regulations—maximizing the benefits and minimizing the costs of INGO activities. Similarly, INGOs will work to find the optimal mix of programming within a country and either work within or push against the boundaries the regime has set. Both parties attempt to mutually benefit from the relationship—but is a mutual arrangement possible? Can both the regime and INGOs benefit, or will one party dominate?

In the remainder of this prospectus, I will outline how I will investigate these puzzles and answer these questions. After briefly reviewing the existing literature on authoritarian institutional balancing and INGO behavior, I lay out a broad theoretical framework with three connected hypotheses. I then describe the ensemble of empirical methods I will use to test and probe these hypotheses. I conclude with a general outline of the future dissertation and a tentative schedule of my research and writing plans.


# Dictators and activists: Reluctant bedfellows

Recent work in political science and international relations has attempted to explain two significant puzzles: the internal workings of authoritarian politics and the international influence of non-state actors. Contrary to conventional wisdom, scholars such as @Blaydes:2011, @LevitskyWay:2010, and @GandhiPrzeworski:2007 have argued that modern authoritarian regimes adopt quasi-democratic political institutions such as free elections, an independent judiciary, or civil society in ways that seem wrong or counterfeit to democratically minded Western observers. This research has shown that authoritarians delegate authority to these institutions in part to maintain their own power, offsetting domestic pressure and boosting their international reputation. 

A separate literature has sought to open the black box of transnational civil society behavior, demonstrating that contrary to the popular idea that civil society can serve as the moral bulwark of the global system, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) are strategic actors that follow their own agendas. In particular, they are susceptible to a host of internal and external pressures and influences, including the institutional environments of countries they are based in [@Stroup:2012], the global demand for their advocated issue [@Bob:2002; @Bob:2005; @Carpenter:2014], or their internal managerial structure [@Wong:2012]. 

However, little research has attempted to combine these two disparate theoretical developments and look the role of transnational civil society (and other non-state actors) *as an institutional actor within* authoritarian regimes. Why do self-interested autocrats allow INGOs to operate in their borders? How are INGOs influenced by pressures from authoritarian regimes they work with?

## Authoritarian institutional balancing

A growing literature on the nuances of autocracy has begun to show that authoritarianism is not simply a transitional phase before democracy, but an altogether distinct regime type where autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010], a phenomenon I will call *institutional balancing* (see [@fig:balancing]). This theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that authoritarians are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism is best viewed as a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other pseudo democratic institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

![Example of an authoritarian regime balancing multiple domestic and international institutional actors](Figures/balancing.pdf) {#fig:balancing}

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can establish narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage, or create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to create popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this dissonance creates an interesting (and potentially destabilizing) competitive dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014]. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

## INGOs: yet another actor to be balanced

Authoritarian institutional balancing is not limited solely to domestic institutions. States today confront a complex stew of domestic and international issues and actors, where activists, bureaucrats, legislators, judges, firms, civil society organizations, international organizations, media organizations, and foreign states interact and influence domestic policy and behavior [@Linos:2013; @Slaughter:2004]. INGOs can provide particularly acute pressure against authoritarian regimes, especially as they work in concert with domestic NGOs to pressure and shame states that behave poorly. Domestic NGOs that are restricted or blocked by their government will turn to allies in the international NGO community, who will in turn lobby their home states to convince international organizations like the UN to put high-level pressure on the offending regime, thereby creating an opening for the original domestic civil society organizations to advocate for policy changes. This relocation of advocacy power follows a boomerang pattern, moving from domestic NGOs to INGOs to foreign states and international organizations to domestic NGOs again [@Keck:1998]. 

With repeated boomerang-like pressure from domestic NGOs and INGOs, responses to individual issues can evolve into human rights norms, resulting in the institutionalization of new policies and practices within an offending state. @RisseSikkink:1999 describe this process of norm socialization as a spiral, or a sequence of repeated boomerang effects. Domestic actors repeatedly turn to INGOs and transnational networks for help in their advocacy and slowly wear down the state. Initially the state denies the accusations of repression and claims that foreign human rights norms are invalid, but with repeated domestic and international pressure, the regime will begin to make concessions to the human rights network. Continued pressure helps formalize these concessions into actual legislation, and as politicians adhere to these policies (again because of domestic and international boomerang effects), they internalize the human rights norms that underpin the policies, thus resulting in long-lasting reform.

Relying on non-state actors as part of domestic institutional balancing is fraught with risk—INGOs are wildcards in authoritarian regimes [@DeMars:2005]. INGOs have real effects on domestic politics and policies and pose significant risks to the regimes that allow them to operate. Countries that receive negative evaluations in human rights INGO reports and press releases see a marked reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows [@BarryClayFlynn:2013] and tend to respond with better compliance to international human rights norms [@Murdie:2012]. Close networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can even marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012].

![Percent of dictatorships that allow domestic and international institutions](Figures/ingos_dictatorships.pdf) {#fig:ingos_dictatorships}

In spite of the risks of dealing with INGOs, authoritarians are increasingly opening up their countries to INGO advocacy and services. @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a show that in general, institutionalization in authoritarian regimes has increased over the past century, as dictatorships permit pseudo-democratic electoral institutions, such as party politics and competitive elections. In [@fig:ingos_dictatorships] I replicate their work and add a fourth measure of institutionalization: the percentage of dictatorships that have citizens who are members of more than 50 different INGOs, shown in orange.^[Data collected from the Yearbook of International Organizations and provided in @Murdie:2013. Unfortunately data is only available from 1990–2010. I plan to expand this dataset in the future.] As seen in the figure, international associational life has also grown more active in more of the world's authoritarian regimes since 1990.

Though associational life has increased, regimes have worked to control its expansion, often through formal and informal restrictions on INGO activity. Ongoing research on the human trafficking advocacy sector demonstrates the pervasiveness of anti-NGO restrictions. In a survey conducted in 2014, 522 human trafficking NGOs answered questions about their work in 132 different countries. One hundred twenty-four NGOs (23.8%) reported feeling either somewhat or very restricted by the governments of 66 of those countries (see [@fig:restrictions-map]).^[Survey respondents were asked "How much is your organization’s work restricted by government regulations in [the country you work in]?" and offered a range of five responses: not restricted, very little restricted, a little restricted, somewhat restricted, and very restricted.] 

![Government restrictions reported by human trafficking NGOs](Figures/restrictions_map.pdf) {#fig:restrictions-map}

The nature of these restrictions varied, ranging from strict legal requirements to general government antagonism or apathy toward INGO programming. For example, one INGO working in Southeast Asia reported "[a]ll work must be approved and done in direct concert with government counterparts. [Our] presence in country [is] controlled and evaluated by government officials, even those who are not familiar with our work," while another stated that "we had to be certified and continue to submit to monthly reporting, mandatory financial audits, site visits, social welfare approval, government regulations regarding our aftercare property, work permits for all foreign volunteers, annual reporting and additional certifications." Some NGOs responded that informal restrictions, such as corruption and inefficiency in the police and government bureaucracy, also limit the programming these organizations can do in-country. Finally, organizations working in democracies like Canada, Australia, or France, reported feeling restricted because of tax code limitations on charitable advocacy, similar to the political advocacy limitations the US imposes on 501(c)(3) charities.

One interesting theme in the responses of these human trafficking NGOs is that many noted that government restrictions are calibrated to help the regime. This is best summarized by the previously cited Southeast Asian INGO, which expressed that "[a]ll of our work is seen through the lens of … party priorities." Sovereign nations engage with international organizations and transnational civil society selectively, depending on rational calculations of how that engagement might be beneficial to the regime. Authoritarian regimes in particular tend to follow international norms and allow INGO operations only when doing so "allows the regime to (1) shore up its authority and legitimacy and to (2) deflect international pressures" [@Hawkins:1997, 407–8, *numbers added*]. Autocrats can use INGOs and other non-state actors to stabilize and reinforce their political power at home. For example, because competition for foreign patronage created an absence of strong links between Russian advocacy groups and the public, the Russian state has been able to restructure the civil society sector so that only NGOs that "work on issues that align with the national interest" receive funding and support [@Henderson:2010, 254], short-circuiting international "spiral" pressure and silencing domestic advocacy movements. 

Authoritarian regimes will also use INGOs and other non-state actors to improve their international reputations. @Kelley:2012 argues that because election monitoring has become a global norm, governments—even those who fully intend on cheating and manipulating the election—permit election monitoring INGOs as a way of appearing credible and democratic to peer nations. To ensure that monitoring efforts do indeed improve the regime's reputation, authoritarian governments will try to circumvent international monitors or purposely invite friendly (or bribable) monitors to counterbalance more objective organizations. Because of this, election monitors can ultimately "contribute to the false legitimization of governments" [@Kelley:2012, 155]. 

These rational strategies have the potential to backfire, however, since authoritarians are rarely able to fully control all rival actors. Though inviting election monitors does provide substantial reputational benefits, the presence of high-quality monitors makes it more difficult to cheat and is associated with better election quality, fewer violations of electoral law, and more incumbent turnover [@Kelley:2012, 124]—rulers in competitive authoritarian regimes can lose monitored elections. In post-revolutionary Egypt, international human rights monitoring organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have benefitted from increased operational latitude as the different regimes have sought to bolster their international reputation. With this greater flexibility, these organizations have been able to issue dozens of reports condemning the government for its human rights abuses. Increased transnational oversight into Egyptian human rights has inadvertently led to increased international shaming and condemnation.

## Explaining INGO behavior

The boomerang and spiral models assume that INGOs will act as objective liaisons between domestic movements and international organizations or states. In their role as global moral police, INGOs should be able to address the most pressing and salient issues, providing any domestic opposition movement with the ability to access international assistance. Unfortunately this assumption is overly optimistic. Like any other institution, INGOs are strategic actors that pursue their own instrumental goals and agendas which are often at odds with the preferences of their home countries, international organizations, or the domestic NGOs they attempt to help [@Risse:2010, 284]. Moreover, their decisions and behavior are influenced heavily by various (1) internal, (2), interactive, and (3) institutional factors 

Internally, INGOs must balance their normative principles against the instrumental need of organizational survival. Unlike states or firms that generally face singular goals, like maximizing national security or maximizing profits, INGOs face a tradeoff between mission and money and must pursue both simultaneously—they must "instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 489]. When their environments are limited and restricted, INGOs face a strain on their stated mission, vision, and values. 

The relationships between INGOs also play a significant role in determining issue adoption. Organizations are most able to push new normative ideas onto the global agenda if they are connected to key nodes—or gatekeepers—in a network, who then vet the proposals and give (or deny) them credibility and legitimacy. In general, the more connected or centralized an INGO is in relation to other organizations, the more influential it will be [@Carpenter:2007; @Carpenter:2014]. As such, domestic issues championed by INGOs in less influential network positions will likely fail to cause a boomerang effect. 

Finally, beyond the influence of internal and interactive forces, an INGO's willingness to pursue particular issues and agendas is shaped by institutional factors. Despite their global scope, INGOs are based within states and are affected by those states' legal regulations, historical precedents, and cultural norms [@Stroup:2012]. For example, CARE USA's mission reflects American norms of efficiency and results-oriented pragmatism by using a professional staff, securing large amounts of government funding, and avoiding anti-American advocacy. In contrast, Amnesty International, based in the United Kingdom, eschews many of the stricter norms of business-like efficiency and professionalization to focus more on advocacy work. These different home-country institutional environments have a direct impact on which issues these INGOs will choose to adopt—NGOs in authoritarian regimes that are more compatible with the home-country norms of INGOs will be more likely to receive boomerang-like support.


# Theoretical argument

Despite this rich and exciting literature on authoritarian institutional balancing, little existing research looks at how international actors (and in particular international NGOs) fit into a dictator's stability-seeking calculus. Correspondingly, no research in the INGO studies field has looked at the effect of domestic authoritarian politics on INGO behavior. To remedy these deficiencies, I intend to address these two research questions throughout this project:

1. How do authoritarian regimes manage international NGOs that work in their countries?
2. How do international NGOs adjust their programming in response to the regulatory environment and domestic politics of the countries they target?

I offer a novel theoretical framework to answer these questions. Using an adaptation of basic negotiation theory [@Raiffa:1982; @Mayer:2010], I argue that the interaction between authoritarian regimes and INGOs in any given issue area (human rights, development, advocacy, etc.) can be modeled in simple two-dimensional policy space (see [@fig:winsets]). Each actor has a preference for a certain level of advocacy or service provision, marked as solid circles in the figure (Regime~ideal~ and INGO~ideal~). Regimes set and implement *de jure* policies to prevent INGO programming from going beyond their ideal point (the reserve value or "best alternative to a negotiated agreement" (BATNA) in negotiation theoretic terms), while INGOs will engage in programming that (when possible) fits within the bounds set by the regime. In addition to these ideal points, each actor has a range of flexibility in the implementation of their regulations or programming, shown in the horizontal lines flanking the ideal points (negotiation space in negotiation theory terms). The space where the two preference ranges overlap (the zone of possible agreement (ZOPA) in negotiation theory) determines both the regime's *de facto* level of restrictions and the INGO's actual mix of programming. 

![Programming preferences in two-dimensional policy space](Figures/winsets.pdf) {#fig:winsets}

An authoritarian regime's INGO regulatory environment comprises two components: (1) formal *de jure* legislation and policies (represented by the ideal point) and (2) *de facto* implementation of those policies (represented by the negotiation space around the ideal point). I expect authoritarian regimes to set one of three broad policies towards international NGOs working in their regimes based on both the initial ideal point and the size of the issue's ZOPA, each falling along a continuum of restrictiveness: (1) *tolerance*, or very few legal or actual restrictions on any activities, (2) *constraint*, or restrictions ranging from minor legal hurdles to major oppression or intimidation, and (3) *expulsion*, or a complete ban of all INGO activities. The larger the ZOPA, the more tolerant the regime will be about INGO programming and activities, and vice versa—when there is no overlap an INGO will face expulsion.

In turn, and analogous to the regime's regulatory environment, an INGO's response to authoritarian restrictions comprises two components: (1) the organization's normative principles and ideals (represented by the ideal point) and (2) the organization's amount of flexibility in actually implementing those principles (represented by the space around the ideal point). I expect INGOs to read with one of three general responses, each falling along a continuum of cooperation: (1) *compliance*, or tolerating and cooperating with the legal limits imposed by the regime, (2) *mitigation*, or creatively working around those policies to continue their work, and (3) *antagonism*, or ignoring and resisting those policies. The degree of cooperation between the two actors is a function of the distance between the two parties' ideal points. INGOs that engage in programming close to the authoritarian regime's preferences will be more compliant with the regulatory environment, while organizations that pursue more contentious programming will be more antagonistic. [@fig:working-theory] demonstrates a mix of possible regulatory environments and INGO responses. 

![Possible authoritarian regulatory environments and corresponding INGO responses](Figures/working_theory.pdf) {#fig:working-theory}

The relationship between INGOs and authoritarian regimes is dynamic, as ideal points shift along the spectrum and negotiation spaces expand or contract. For example, if an INGO can decide to pursue more antagonistic programming without a corresponding expansion in the permissiveness of the regulatory environment, it will face harsher restrictions (see top panel of [@fig:winsets_shift]). Similarly, if an INGO shifts its ideal level of programming to be more compliant and cooperative, it will face fewer restrictions (see bottom panel of [@fig:winsets_shift]). INGOs can also react to changes in the regulatory environment. If a regime suddenly constricts its regulatory environment, an INGO can either (1) maintain its preferences and face harsher restrictions or expulsion, or (2) shift its ideal point leftward and be more compliant. 

![Changes in the regulatory environment and INGO response following a shift in INGO preferences](Figures/winsets_shift.pdf) {#fig:winsets_shift}

In my research, I intend to discover the determinants of the ideal points and negotiation spaces for both authoritarian regimes and international NGOs. Each of the hypotheses I will test are directly connected to this two-dimensional framework. I offer two general hypotheses to explain (1) the formation and implementation of authoritarian INGO policies, and (2) the selection of and changes to INGO programming and strategies within authoritarian regimes. These hypotheses can be stated as simple linked functions (below) and are shown in greater detail in [@fig:framework]. 

> **Regulatory environment for INGOs**  
{Tolerance, Constraint, Expulsion} = regime stability (H~1~) + regime preferences for INGO issue (H~2~)

> **INGO response to regulatory environment**  
{Compliance, Mitigation, Antagonism} = regulatory environment + normative principles (H~3~) + operational flexibility (H~4~)

![Theoretical framework](Figures/theoretical_framework.pdf) {#fig:framework}

## Hypotheses and testable implications

### Authoritarian regimes

As described previously, the nature of authoritarian institutional meddling takes on many different forms and is done with different purposes. For example, dictators will co-opt legislatures to dole out the benefits of regime patronage to the elites and allow for better, more reliable monitoring of elite loyalty [@Blaydes:2011]; capture or co-opt domestic civil society organizations to enhance service provision and citizen monitoring; or tacitly permit controlled popular protests to give citizens an outlet to vent their dissatisfaction with the government [@Chen:2012] or signal state intentions during international negotiations [@Weiss:2013]. Each of these pseudo-democratic domestic institutions (elections, civil society, state-sanctioned popular protests) enhance regime stability. I contend that, just as they do with other domestic actors and institutions, dictators must carefully balance and contend with international NGOs. 

Key to harnessing this institutional dissonance for stability, however, is the autocrat's ability to manage and control these external actors. When dealing with domestic challengers and institutions, dictators have a wide array of policy choices to manipulate and control their influence, ranging from formal legislation against certain activities to imprisoning and torturing recalcitrant legislators, judges, or activists. Autocrats have a more limited menu of policy options for controlling international actors, however, because of their nationality. While it maybe be easy to harass and imprison the family of a native activist, attempts to jail or torture international advocates or aid workers are far more risky, as foreigners often have the legal and political backing of their home states. Though there are a handful of instances of authoritarian regimes attempting to formally prosecute foreigners (e.g. in 2013 an Egyptian court convicted 16 American NGO workers, and the government continues to detain reporters and cameramen from the Al Jazeera news network), dictators generally only have one type of policy lever to control INGOs: increasing or decreasing legal restrictions related to INGO advocacy and service provision.

I thus argue that the restrictiveness of an autocrat's regulatory environment for international NGOs is directly related to the regime's need for stability, resulting in my first hypothesis: 

> **H~1~**: When authoritarian regimes perceive themselves to be more stable, the *de jure* and *de facto* regulatory environment for international NGOs will be less restrictive (and vice versa—more unstable regimes will have more restrictive INGO regulations).

That is, when it is stable, an authoritarian regime's ideal point and negation space will shift towards the right, providing more openings for INGO activity. Conversely, instability causes a leftward shift and constricts potential INGO activity.

This hypothesis leads to two testable implications:

* Formal *de jure* legislation regulating international civil society will be passed during times of instability.
* The *de facto* application of the regulatory environment will be more restrictive and harsh during times of instability.

I will argue that there are at least three observable and measurable sources of stability:

1. *Domestic tensions*: factors that threaten a regime's domestic stability, including the threat of competitive elections, relations between ethnic groups, opposition organizations gaining power relative to the regime, etc.
2. *International reputation*: regimes often care about how they are perceived by major world powers and the international community^[For example, dictatorships will invite international election monitors to oversee an election to gain credibility, while also fully intending to cheat [@Kelley:2012].]—a good international reputation can imply or display domestic stability.^[For example, as Kazakhstan mulled over a more restrictive NGO law in 2005, the United States argued that "the best way for Kazakhstan to distinguish itself from its neighbors" was to respect international and domestic institutions, conducting fair presidential elections in 2006 and not passing the NGO law. See "KAZAKHSTANI MFA 'DISAPPOINTED' WITH CERTIFICATION DECISION," State Department Cable 05ALMATY1938, [https://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/05/05ALMATY1938.html](https://wikileaks.org/cable/2005/05/05ALMATY1938.html).]
3. *Fear of contagion*: events in neighboring countries (such as the threat of revolution) can influence the stability of a regime—dictators will react to the instability of their neighbors to maintain their own domestic stability.

The internal dynamics of an authoritarian regime define much of the regime's response to and attitude towards international NGOs. However, the nature of the organizations that work in the country also influences the regime's INGO policies. In particular, regimes will adjust the *de facto* INGO regulatory environment based on the advocacy or services INGOs provide:

> **H~2~**: When the issue area an INGO works with is more aligned with the preferences and needs of a regime, the *de facto* implementation of the regulatory environment for INGOs will be less restrictive (and vice versa—organizations working with more contentious issues will face stricter INGO applied regulations).

That is, the regime's negotiation space will expand rightwards toward INGOs that pursue programming aligned with the regime's needs and will shift away from INGOs that engage in programming that more contentious.

This hypothesis implies that the *de facto* application of INGO legal restrictions will vary by the issue areas different INGOs pursue and the needs of the regime. For example, a regime that actively seeks out education INGOs in an effort to improve local education programming will be less restrictive with those organizations, while simultaneously acting more harshly against freedom of expression INGOs that advocate against the regime.

Both of these hypotheses are admittedly broad and generic. At first blush it seems obvious that unstable regimes will restrict INGO activity when it conflicts with their interests, while more stable regimes will strategically embrace INGO activity when it is advantageous to do so. However, the empirical application of these hypotheses is more nuanced, as a regime's preferences for INGO services can enhance or decrease regime stability. For example, regimes can loosen up restrictions on international advocacy during times of instability—such as allowing international election monitors to observe contested elections [@Kelley:2012]—in an effort to improve stability. Similarly, regimes can impose harsher restrictions on INGOs during times of political stability—though China is currently in the midst of an unprecedented expansion of civil society and has cooperated with dozens of international NGOs, the regime has shuttered several small INGOs that work with seemingly innocuous issues like advocacy for disabled people.^[Josh Chin, "China Cracks Down on Foreign Nonprofits," *The Wall Street Journal*, March 6, 2015, [http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cracks-down-on-foreign-nonprofits-1425694223](http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cracks-down-on-foreign-nonprofits-1425694223).] These simple counterfactuals indicate that there is a sort of tipping point in the cost-benefit calculus for restricting INGOs. When will fewer restrictions lead to more regime stability, and conversely, when will a stable regime impose harsher restrictions?

Recent game theoretic research has attempted to address this question of the optimization of repression, finding that China permits or disallows anti-government investigative reporting based on the government's current attitude to corruption and the current threat of revolution [@Lorentzen:2014], with equilibria that dynamically shift depending on the structure of a regime's payoffs. I will argue that a regime's optimization of INGO restrictions will follow a similar pattern. Though H~1~ and H~2~ are stated simply, the different components of stability and regime preferences will interact dynamically—for example, increased domestic instability might influence a regime's desire to enhance international reputation, leading to a strategic decision to decrease INGO restrictions.


### International NGOs

International and transnational NGOs do not operate in a vacuum. As described previously, INGOs are influenced by a host of factors beyond their stated mission vision, values, and strategies. In addition to these well established behavioral determinants, I argue that the regulatory environment for foreign-based advocacy and service provision in autocratic nations plays a significant role in shaping the behavior of international NGOs that work in those countries. 

An INGO's mission and menu of programs will often conflict with the preferences of the regime—for example, a freedom of expression INGO will likely pursue advocacy that is antagonistic towards Chinese speech, censorship, and media policy. Accordingly, an organization must decide how to adapt its programming to fit the requirements and needs of its host country. This decision can be difficult, pitting conflicting organizational values against each other. If the organization is too antagonistic or contentious, it runs the risk of expulsion, potentially leaving the INGO unable to continue its work in the country. However, if the organization is too cooperative, its selection of programs may not be credible or effective as the NGO kowtows to the dictator's demands. 

The degree to which an INGO is cooperative or antagonistic is most easily seen through its selection of programming, or the advocacy and services the organizations attempt to implement within the authoritarian country. The decision to antagonize or cooperate with the regime (and, in turn, adjust its programming) is largely a function of (1) the existing regulatory environment, (2) an INGO's original ideal preferences for programming, or its normative principles, and (3) how much power and flexibility an INGO has in relation to the regime. 

Both ideology and flexibility work in concert to explain the selection of (and changes in) an INGO's menu of programming. INGOs are driven primarily by their objective ideological principles (i.e. adherence to an overarching mission or vision statement), but are also constrained by the realities of implementation [@MitchellSchmitz:2014]. Temporarily disregarding flexibility, it is clear that an organization with an ideal point outside of the regime's established regulatory environment will need to change its strategy to continue its operations within the authoritarian nation. This pressure to change programs leads to the following hypothesis: 

> **H~3~**: Holding flexibility constant, an international NGO with ideal preferences that fall outside the allowable regulatory environment will face pressure to temper its programming  and become more compliant to regime demands (and vice versa—organizations with preferences that fall within the regulatory environment will maximize the contentiousness of their advocacy or service provision). 

An INGO can resist this pressure to comply, however, by increasing its operational flexibility, or its negotiation space. I define flexibility as the INGO's ability to protect and expand its menu of programming, maximizing the organization's overlap with the regime's preferences (or the ZOPA) while maintaining the organization's normative ideal point. If an INGO is able to marshal resources, work with more partner organizations, request the support of powerful external actors, or pursue other strategies to circumvent, mitigate, or otherwise reduce the impact of government regulations on their total menu of programming, the negotiation space will expand and the regulatory environment will be less restrictive. My final hypothesis encapsulates this dynamic:

> **H~4~**: When an international NGO has more operational flexibility in its provision of services or advocacy, the organization's overlap with regime preferences will increase and the INGO will face fewer restrictions (and vice versa—organizations with less flexibility will face harsher restrictions).

I will argue that there are several observable and measurable forms of operational flexibility, each with different effects on an INGO's response to regime regulations:

1. *Programming flexibility*: an INGO that offers a diversity of programming in a country (or in neighboring countries) can shuffle resources between those programs, while an INGO that pursues a single program in a county will be more threatened by harsh regulations.^[For example, smaller INGOs in Russia in 1990s that were funded exclusively by USAID were unable to pursue any public health programming that involved AIDS or birth control [@Henderson:2003, 86–87].]
2. *Network flexibility*: an INGO that is linked to more powerful nodes in an issue area network can use those connections to increase its flexibility, while an INGO that is more isolated will have less external support against a restrictive legal environment. This external support network includes other INGOs working on similar issue areas (e.g. an INGO that partners with a prominent organization like Reporters without Borders or Amnesty International will have enhanced flexibility by nature of those relationships) or foreign foundations and government agencies (e.g. an education INGO with formal support from USAID or DFID will have more protection against restrictions).
3. *Flexibility in application of regulations*:^[This form of flexibility, while important, is the most difficult to systematically measure.] an INGO has the ability to circumvent or ignore regulations and exploit legal loopholes (e.g. an organization might be able to open a local branch under a different name, the government might be unable to enforce strict registration requirements, or a local executive director may have personal connections with mid-level bureaucrats who turn a blind eye to some programming). 

In some cases, the empirical implications of these hypotheses are obvious, as seen in the corner cases of [@fig:working-theory]. Organizations with maximum flexibility and that correspondingly face no restrictions will naturally be able to behave according to their ideal preferences and will either (1) cooperate with the government when the space between regime and INGO ideal points is small, as in the case of Chinese consultative authoritarianism [@Teets:2014], or, (2) as in weak states like Haiti and Afghanistan, when the space between regime and INGO ideal points is large, antagonize the government at will and operate beyond its regulations. Conversely, organizations with no flexibility will naturally face the harshest restrictions and will either (1) be kicked out in spite of the benefits they offer the regime, even if the space between regime and ideal points is small, as in the case of China's ongoing shuttering of innocuous INGOs, or (2) if the space between regime and INGO ideal points is large, be forced to antagonize the regime from abroad, as with Human Rights Watch and the Carter Center, which are both currently barred from Egypt. 

The link between restrictions and flexibility is clearest (and most interesting) when applied to organizations that are in tension with the regime and that face smaller, more dynamic overlapping preferences  (the center column highlighted in grey in [@fig:working-theory]). In this environment, organizations with lower levels of flexibility will struggle to maneuver and circumvent regime regulations, often leading to unwanted cooperation with the regime. For example, if a hypothetical INGO that teaches new media skills to state-employed reporters wants to teach skills that promote independent antagonistic reporting, but is unable to because it is unable to mitigate or challenge existing INGO regulations, it will necessarily cooperate with the regime and shift its preferences leftward. If that INGO had more flexibility, however, such as formal backing from the State Department, or other in-country programs it could shift its attention to, its ZOPA with regime preferences would increase and it would be less inclined to change its programming.

## A note on inductive and deductive research

As they stand now, these hypotheses are quite deductive, outlining a potential theory of regime and INGO behavior. As such, the hypotheses and implications are admittedly broad and potentially too simplistic. However, because the phenomena I intend on studying are so complex, I believe that my general arguments will allow me to usefully frame my empirical research without getting too bogged down in minutia. 

At the same time, I fully expect to inductively discover more interesting trends as I collect and analyze data. For instance, it very well may be that my current categorization of flexibility does not map neatly in real life and that I will find other, more accurate, ways of predicting INGO programming and cooperation. Though I will not present these "found" trends as hypotheses (it would be unethical to retroactively reframe my existing hypotheses to match the data I find), my empirical analysis will likely be based around the patterns I induce from the data. 


# Methods

Studying INGOs that work in authoritarian regimes poses a difficult methodological challenge. There is extensive cross-country research on *domestic* authoritarian institutions [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014; @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a;  @FrantzEzrow:2011], as well as detailed case studies of individual authoritarian regimes [@Blaydes:2011; @Chen:2012; @Weiss:2013; @Teets:2014; @Hildebrandt:2013; @Brownlee:2007], and autocracies in general [@LevitskyWay:2010]. However, beyond the excellent work by @Teets:2014, little research has looked at how authoritarian regimes and international nongovernmental institutions interact.

Studying INGOs is difficult as there is little existing structured data on INGO activities or behavior. These organizations publish a wealth of unstructured data, such as annual reports, budgets, press releases, or calls to advocacy, but few have systematically compiled these data sources into usable datasets. Existing research either relies on event data parsed from large corpora of news reports or highly specific in-depth case studies based on interviews and other unstructured data. Each of these approaches, however, pose methodological challenges. Event data often yields weak or uninteresting results since event data algorithms were originally developed to track wars and interactions between global elites—not NGOs—while case studies tend to be too focused on a handful of prominent organizations, resulting in findings and theories that are likely not very generalizable [@BloodgoodSchmitz:2013; @MitchellSchmitz:2014]. For example, human rights INGO research has thus far been primarily concerned with Amnesty International and other similar organizations, such as Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), CARE International, or Oxfam [@Stroup:2012; @Wong:2012]. While there is utility in amassing thick descriptions of INGO activities, more must be done. Mitchell and Schmitz argue that INGO case studies need to be combined with large, more representative analyses to better understand the organizations that work on specific issue areas as a whole. @Kelley:2012 and @Buthe:2011 do this well, looking at the election monitoring INGO sector and the world of standards setting as a whole while also including more detailed studies of selected cases from those sectors. 

I plan to follow a similar approach and combine detailed descriptive case studies based on surveys, interviews, and archival research with broader, medium-*n* panel data for all authoritarian regimes worldwide. Once I have collected this data, I will use an integrated ensemble of methods to explore and test each of my three hypotheses at both a broader macro level (world- and sector-wide) and at a narrow micro level (two authoritarian nations and a randomly selected group of organizations). 

The data I plan to collect will require a range of specialized language and technical skills, and I believe I have the requisite experience and resources. Since I am planning on focusing on two specific authoritarian countries—Egypt and China—I will need to consult foreign language archives and sources. I have studied Arabic since 2002, have lived and travelled extensively in the region, and have previously done Arabic-language historical archival research for a master's thesis, and thus feel confident in my language skills. However, I have little experience with Chinese and unfortunately do not have enough years to set aside to learn that language. As such, I intend to apply for funding from Duke and from outside sources^[Including the Smith Richardson Foundation's World Politics and Statecraft Fellowship—see [https://www.srf.org/programs/world-politics-statecraft-fellowship/](https://www.srf.org/programs/world-politics-statecraft-fellowship/).] to hire a Chinese-speaking undergraduate research assistant. Before receiving funding, I plan to consult with Chinese-speaking relatives and colleagues (as well as Google Translate) to begin preliminary research. 

My general approach is summarized below in [@tbl:methods].

## Testing hypothesis 1: INGO legislation and stability

I plan on first testing the relationship between regime stability and INGO restrictions using a medium-*n* cross national dataset of INGO restrictions that I will create based on a host of primary and secondary sources. This type of data collection process is not unprecedented—@DupuyRonPrakash:2012 provide a list of formal legal restrictions against foreign funding of domestic civil society organizations in 26 authoritarian states in Africa, and @DupuyRonPrakash:2014a use an expanded set of 45 countries to predict the conditions under which a country will adopt foreign funding restrictions. While the authors have not shared their final datasets, they do provide information about the nearly 20 different sources they used to identify and code funding restrictions, including reports from the International Center for Non-Profit Law, the US State Department, CIVICUS, the International Center for Civil Society Law, and others. 

I intend to use this list of sources (and any other reports and legislation I can find) to create a more comprehensive set of formal legal restrictions on international NGOs in all authoritarian nations, including any type of law that contributes to the overall legal environment governing INGO behavior (i.e. not just restrictions on foreign funding flows). [@fig:sample-data] shows an example of what the ultimate dataset might look like. Upon completion, I will make this dataset publicly available online at ingorestrictions.org and will provide regular updates to the data.^[See [http://ingorestrictions.org](http://ingorestrictions.org), which currently has a simple placeholder page.]

![Example of future *de facto* INGO restrictions dataset](Figures/sample_data.png) {#fig:sample-data}

I will be able to combine this data with other existing data sources on regime stability—such as the International Country Risk Guide's (ICRG) government stability measure,^[See [http://www.prsgroup.com/about-us/our-two-methodologies/icrg](http://www.prsgroup.com/about-us/our-two-methodologies/icrg).] the State Fragility Index,^[See [http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html](http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html).], or the Fragile States Index^[See [http://library.fundforpeace.org/fsi](http://library.fundforpeace.org/fsi).]—and build explanatory and predictive statistical models to test the association between stability and restriction.

At the micro level, I plan on further testing the relationship between different dimensions of regime stability and restrictiveness towards INGOs by carefully tracing the development of the INGO regulatory environment in my two primary country cases: Egypt and China (a full explanation of my case selection rationale and process is included in the next section). I will use legislative transcripts (if available), local and international media reports regarding the debates over the legislation (both in draft and in final form), and interviews with activists (and possibly government officials (though this will likely be difficult)) to examine the domestic political environment that provided the background for the passage of different laws, explicitly linking legislation to incidents of instability, threats of revolution, fears of international contagion, or desires to increase international reputation. 


## Testing hypothesis 2: INGO legislation and regime preferences

To test the relationship between the *de facto* application of INGO restrictions and the regime's policy preferences, I plan on detailing the experiences of INGOs working on two different issue areas—freedom of expression and education—in both Egypt and China (again, full justification for both the two countries and the two sectors follows in the next section). I will use local and international media archives, press releases, and official government and INGO reports to trace the relationship between the two sectors and the two governments. In particular, I will compare changes in the expected level of contentiousness of an issue—for example, China's explosive economic growth in the late 2000s likely led to heightened interest in both education services and the appearance of expression rights, while Egypt's 2011 uprising led to tentative expansions in expression rights, followed by harsh crackdowns—with changes in the *de facto* regulatory environment.

While I would like to create a comprehensive global dataset of the *de facto* application of INGO restrictions, doing so is unfortunately infeasible. As mentioned previously, event data tools can be powerful in some domains, but they are currently immature for INGO research. However, I am communicating with the developers of the most cutting edge event data service (the Phoenix Data Project^[See [http://phoenixdata.org](http://phoenixdata.org).], a project of the Open Event Data Alliance) to include a comprehensive list of INGO actors (explained below) in their algorithm. It is unlikely that I'll have any useful data for this dissertation, but in the future I will hopefully be able to get a good global picture of INGO restrictions.

## Testing hypotheses 3 and 4: INGO responses to regulatory environment

As with my collection of data on regime restrictions on INGOs, I plan on collecting data on INGOs themselves at two levels. I will first create a comprehensive database of education and freedom of expression organizations in order to summarize the two sectors in general. I will scrape data from the Yearbook of International Organizations (YIO), which provides a wealth of information on INGOs, including the countries the organizations work in, staff sizes, budgets, formal connections to other organizations, and subject headings—usefully, the "Communications / Press" and "Education" subjects include hundreds of organizations. I will then feed the initial YIO list into IssueCrawler, a research tool that maps out connections between organizational websites to approximate a sort of sector-wide network structure and find other related organizations the YIO will have missed.

With these two complete databases, I will then be able to conduct two sector-wide surveys in an attempt to measure the distance between INGOs' ideal and actual levels of programming in the countries they work in.^[These surveys will be similar to the survey of human trafficking NGOs I have conducted over the past year for Judith Kelley.] I plan to poll these INGOs about their relationships with the host government, their knowledge of the legal environment, their experiences with *de facto* restrictions, and their flexibility in ideology and programming. 

At the micro level, I will use these databases to select a collection of organizations that I will look at in detail (see case study section below for my justification of organization selection). I plan to interview and survey staff, closely read annual reports and press releases, and (if possible) analyze financial records to determine the relationship between these INGOs' flexibility and their programming response to the authoritarian regulatory environment. I will also be able to use the databases to sketch the networks of the sectors to determine if peer relationships influence these organizations' choice of programming (for example, one very well connected organization may have more autonomy and flexibility because it collaborates directly with a central node organization in the education network). 


# Case selection

As explained previously, my research will use detailed and multidimensional case studies to complement medium-*n* quantitative data. Specifically, I will carefully investigate several INGOs that pursue one of two policy issues (freedom of expression and education) in Egypt and China—two excellent cases of pseudo-competitive dictatorship. [@fig:case-selection] provides a graphical overview of my case selection.

![Overview of case selection and research design](Figures/case_selection.pdf) {#fig:case-selection}

## Countries

Rather than study the effect of domestic politics on INGO policy in every known dictatorship, I plan to limit my case-based research to Egypt and China. I do so for several reasons: 

1. Both are highly salient cases, given the rapid growth of civil society in China and China's prominent position in the global economy, and due to tumultuous post-revolutionary politics in Egypt.
2. Both are excellent examples of authoritarian institutional balancing, as each has devolved limited power to both domestic institutions and international NGOs in pursuit of stability.
3. There is intense scholarly debate over which countries qualify as "dictatorships," with multiple competing definitions (such as Polity IV, Freedom House, etc.). I can circumvent this debate by selecting two cases that clearly fit the authoritarian mold.

## Issue areas

My second hypothesis argues that authoritarian INGO policies are influenced by the alignment of the INGO sector's programming with the regime's preferences. Researchers commonly distinguish between INGOs that provide services—ensuring freedom from want—and advocacy—ensuring freedom from fear [@Murdie:2014; @Stroup:2012]. I believe this distinction also generally maps to regime preferences for an issue area. That is, an authoritarian regime will be more tolerant of INGOs that advocate and provide services that directly benefit the regime, and—conversely—less tolerant of those that threaten the regime. 

In order to provide sufficient variation in my dependent variable and primary independent variables, the issue areas I select must provide (1) heterogeneity in the types of programs and services organizations provide, (2) heterogeneity in the level of contentiousness with the ruling regime, and (3) theoretical leverage and generalizability. I argue that two prominent INGO sectors—freedom of expression and education—fulfill these requirements. Both issues are enshrined in the UN Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and theoretically have global support from UN-member countries (including most authoritarian nations). Each issue can also be classified as service provision (education) and advocacy (freedom of expression). Importantly, however, both issues can pose a potential threat to regimes—education and freedom of expression INGOs ostensibly try to shape how a regime *teaches* and *provides information* to its population. [@fig:regime-preferences] summarizes the predicted variation in these sectors' contentiousness with the authoritarian regimes they work with.

![Hypothesized regime preferences to INGO policy issues](Figures/regime_preferences.pdf) {#fig:regime-preferences}

### Education INGOs (EINGOs)

Despite its relative lack of attention in academic research, education has become a crucial pillar of the UN's development program: Article 26 of the UDHR enshrines a universal right to education, and the UN's second Millennium Development Goal (MDG) aims to achieve universal primary education worldwide. Developed states have led the Education for All (EFA) movement for decades, and tensions between national sovereignty and global oversight of education have been a useful case for studying issues of sovereignty in a globalized world [@Mundy:2010]. Prior to the 1990s, UNESCO, the World Bank, UNICEF, and other formal intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) led the EFA movement and framed education as an issue of international development, which opened doors to millions of dollars in funding from USAID, DFID, and other state-based aid agencies. 

Starting in the 1990s, however, in conjunction with the worldwide surge in transnational organizations, education INGOs (EINGOs) began to take the lead in EFA efforts, fueled by government grants and private donations [@Mundy:2010; @ButheMajorMello-e-Souza:2012]. For example, a coalition of INGOs led by Oxfam International, ActionAid, and Education International created the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), which pressures states to adhere to the UDHR and MDGs and advocate for "the millions of adults and children who are denied their right to education."^[See [http://www.campaignforeducation.org/en/about-us/about-education-for-all](http://www.campaignforeducation.org/en/about-us/about-education-for-all).] GCE partners with dozens of well known organizations, including CARE International, Save the Children, and Global March on Child Labor. 

Though it is generally categorized as a development issue (and should thus probably be less contentious than traditional human rights advocacy), education provision and advocacy has significant variation in contentiousness, both in the conflict between state sovereignty and global governance (e.g. leaders often don't want to outsource education provision to outsiders, even in the US), and in conflicting values—Chinese officials have been wary of US-based universities entering higher education^[For example, see "China says no room for 'western values' in university education," *The Guardian*, January 30, 2015, [http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/china-says-no-room-for-western-values-in-university-education](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/30/china-says-no-room-for-western-values-in-university-education).], and actors in states like Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria have often been vehemently opposed to Western education in general.^[See the Taliban and Malala Yousafzai in Pakistan, the Taliban in Afghanistan, and Boko Haram in Nigeria, for example.] EINGOs are highly entangled in domestic debates over education policy and thus fertile ground for shifting regulations.

### Freedom of expression INGOs (FEINGOs)

Like the EFA movement, the freedom of expression movement is based on the UN's UDHR. Article 19 declares that "[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers." Since the signing of the UDHR, hundreds of freedom of expression INGOs (FEINGOs) have been formed to advocate for and provide enhanced services for this universal right. Some organizations, such as Article19, Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the International Press Institute work with regimes to promote policy reforms related to media regulation, censorship, defamation, and intellectual property (among others) and create global indices of censorship and press freedom. Some of these organizations are involved in actual litigation, but others attempt to work with authoritarian regimes to propose and enact reforms. 

Some organizations also provide more tangible services. For example, International Media Support provides training to journalist unions, associations, and press councils and gives technical training on media business development to independent (and pseudo-independent) media outlets in authoritarian regimes in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. BBC Media Action, the BBC's formal charitable foundation, provides similar services by training local media organizations around the world in news production.

Authoritarian regimes have a proven history of strategically using foreign private actors to control and limit freedom of expression rights in their countries, despite the good intentions of actors in this issue area. For example, as a precondition to enter the huge Chinese market, Google, Microsoft, and Apple have all had to make freedom of expression concessions to the Chinese government, removing references to Tiananmen Square and other controversial topics—self-censorship that has angered many in the United States. Other private US- and UK-based firms sell IT security software help Middle Eastern governments surveil and censor activists and limit public consumption of information.^[Amar Toor and Russell Brandom, "A Spy in the Machine," *The Verge*, [http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7861645/finfisher-spyware-let-bahrain-government-hack-political-activist](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7861645/finfisher-spyware-let-bahrain-government-hack-political-activist).]

Recent research shows that authoritarian regimes have purposely turned to FEINGOs to better control information. Despite the near-utopian optimistic view that the internet would allow activists and journalists to circumvent surveillance and overthrow dictatorships, governments have become quite tech savvy: "Many [governments] went from spectators in the digital revolution to sophisticated early adopters of advanced technologies that allowed them to monitor content, activists, and journalists, and direct the flow of information" [@BennettNaim:2015]. Because direct censorship of the media and press is costly, authoritarian regimes have increasingly turned to a strategy of "stealth censorship," creating pseudo private firms and government-operated NGOs (GONGOs) that appear to be members of civil society that care about freedom of expression, but are really just government agencies. 

The fact that authoritarian regimes are beginning to use traditional institutions that enshrine freedom of expression—such as an independent press and the internet—to increase their own stability provides variation in regime response to these INGOs. Despite their intentions of advocating for a free press and for expression rights, FEINGOs are entangled in domestic authoritarian politics.

## Organizations

Having narrowed down my cases to EINGOs and FEINGOs that work in Egypt and China, I must still decide how many and which specific organizations to look at in detail. To provide some leverage and external generalizability to my case research, I plan on selecting a (mostly) random mix of organizations from the complete sector-wide databases (see [@tbl:case_mix]). I will select at least one large or prominent INGO from each sector that works in both Egypt and China (likely not selected at random) to compare the differences in programming across the countries, in addition to several INGOs (selected at random) that do not necessarily work in both countries.
 
!INCLUDE "Tables/case_selection.md"

Ultimately, many of my empirical findings will hinge on the organizations I select. To check for external validity, I will conclude by briefly testing my findings on another set of INGOs—either the top *n* NGOs in the sector or selected at random. 


# Tentative plans

## Outline

Due to the complexity of my argument (and because of the disciplinary norms of political science), I plan to structure my dissertation as a book, with the intention that I will be able to refine it and propose it to an academic publisher following its successful defense. I will include a chapter for each hypothesis, testing the implications of each at both a macro (all authoritarian governments and all INGOs involved in the issue area) and a micro level (selected INGOs working in China and Egypt). Predictably, these central chapters will be prefaced by chapters for the introduction and exposition of the theory. The dissertation will conclude with a chapter where I will summarize my findings, apply the theory to a subset of other INGOs, and make policy recommendations for INGOs working in authoritarian regimes.

## Schedule

As already explained, this research project will require intense qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, involving multiple languages, interviews, surveys, web scraping, and systematic coding. However, I believe that I will be able to complete all the data collection, analysis, and writing in the next two years.^[Research has found that, on average, married male PhD students complete their degrees 0.32 years faster than single male students and are 75% and 66% more likely to complete their degree by their 4th or 5th year, respectively [@Price:2006]. With the imminent birth of child #4, I believe that this accelerative effect will only intensify.] [@fig:timeline] provides a general overview of my tentative project timeline. For now, it is quite ambitious (as it has me finishing in October 2016), and I fully anticipate that the timeline will get stretched out by several months as I delve into the data collection and analysis. 

![*Very* tentative, hyper accelerated, overly ambitious, sure-to-be stretched out, and incomplete timeline for dissertation research](Figures/timeline.pdf) {#fig:timeline}
