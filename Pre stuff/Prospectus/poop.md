INGOs have been instrumental in promoting human rights and humanitarian services over the past several decades. 

\# of INGOs, something on effectiveness? \# of schools, improvement in media policy, progress toward MDGs, etc.

At the same time, these improvements have not led to increased democratization (as predicted?) - improvement in services, no improvement in political structure. Authoritarianism appears as established and stable as ever, even in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring

This is because of a new type of authoritarianism - called hybrid, competitive, previously thought of as an exception to the rule - but they're not exceptions—this is the standard form of authoritarianism today. Dictators use pseudo democratic institutions to stay in power. Elections, etc. BUT ALSO, interestingly, INGOs. Show graph from article + my added INGO data.

In my dissertation, I intend to argue that INGOs are used as an instrument for authoritarian survival. This has implications for INGOs that work in dictatorships, as it can affect the programs and services these organizations offer.

INGO behavior influenced by lots of stuff - networks, internal structure, home institutional environment, BUT ALSO the countries that they work in. 

INGO programming changes because of authoritarian survival strategies.

I will use an ensemble of methods to argue this…

# Dictators and activists: Unlikely bedfellows

Recent work in political science and international relations has attempted to explain two significant puzzles: the internal workings of authoritarian politics and the international influence of non-state actors. Contrary to conventional wisdom, scholars such as @Blaydes:2011, @LevitskyWay:2010, and @GandhiPrzeworski:2007 have argued that modern authoritarian regimes adopt quasi-democratic political institutions such as free elections, an independent judiciary, or civil society in ways that seem "wrong" to democratically minded Western observers. This research has shown that authoritarians delegate authority to these institutions in part to maintain their own power, offsetting domestic pressure and boosting their international reputation. 

A separate literature has sought to open the black box of transnational civil society behavior, demonstrating that contrary to the popular idea that civil society can serve as the moral bulwark of the global system, international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) are strategic actors that follow their own agendas. In particular, they are susceptible to a host of internal and external pressures and influences, including the institutional environments of countries they are based in [@Stroup:2012], the global demand for their advocated issue [@Bob:2002; @Bob:2005; @Carpenter:2014], or their internal managerial structure [@Wong:2012]. 

However, little research has attempted to combine these two disparate theoretical developments and look the role of transnational civil society (and other non-state actors) *as an institutional actor within* authoritarian regimes. Why do self-interested autocrats allow INGOs to operate in their borders? How are INGOs influenced by pressures from authoritarian regimes they work with?

## Authoritarian institutional balancing

A growing literature on the nuances of autocracy has begun to show that authoritarianism is not simply a transitional phase before democracy, but an altogether distinct regime type where autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010], a phenomenon I will call *institutional balancing*. This newer theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that authoritarians are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements. Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism is best viewed as a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and other pseudo democratic institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

Political institutions lie at the core of modern authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can create narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage. Regimes can also create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to create popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a; @Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this devolution of control to third parties—many of which can be actively opposed to the regime—creates an interesting (and potentially destabilizing) competitive dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government [@FrantzKendall-Taylor:2014]. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

![Percent of dictatorships that allow domestic and international institutions](Figures/ingos_dictatorships.pdf)

Authoritarian institutional balancing is not limited solely to domestic institutions. States today confront a complex stew of domestic and international issues and actors, where activists, bureaucrats, legislators, judges, firms, civil society organizations, international organizations, media organizations, and foreign states interact and influence domestic policy and behavior [@Linos:2013; @Slaughter:2004]. In particular, dictators have increasingly opened up their countries to INGO advocacy and services. Figure X replicates work by @Kendall-TaylorFrantz:2014a, showing that an increasing percentage of dictatorships has devolved some authority to electoral institutions, such as party politics and competitive elections. In addition to these pseudo-democratic domestic institutions, the orange line—the percentage of dictatorships that have citizens who are members of more than 50 different INGOs^[Data collected from the Yearbook of International Organization and provided in @Murdie:2013.]—shows that since the 1990s, international associational life has grown increasingly active in more and more authoritarian regimes.

These INGOS and other international actors can act as powerful institutional pressures against and challenges to authoritarian regimes. Countries that receive negative evaluations in human rights INGO reports and press releases see a marked reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows [@BarryClayFlynn:2013] and tend to respond with better compliance to international human rights norms [@Murdie:2012]. Tight, intermestic networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can even marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002], while INGOs in countries like Haiti and Afghanistan vie for control over territorial "fiefdoms" and rival the central government in power and influence [@Schuller:2012].

## International NGO behavior

Established now that pseudo-democratic institutions let dictators stay in power. Participation in IGOs?

Working with INGOs, though? What about non-state actors?

Given the potential influence INGOs have in authoritarian regimes…

Boomerangs and spirals…

When will INGOs get involved in a country? Do they have to balance any normative concerns of regime repression with their principles, missions, and values?

Studying INGOs themselves, rather than the countries they work in and the regimes they work with (or against), remains an understudied area of IR. Part of the reason for this is because INGOs have unique organizational challenges and are thus difficult to research. Previous research has found that INGOs are driven by a set of normative principles and work to force states "toward normative convergence and international cooperation" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 488].^[See also the host of literature based on @Keck:1998.] Others have found that INGOs instead behave as firms in a competitive market, driven by instrumental concerns of survival and strategy.^[See @Cooley:2002; @Bob:2002; among others.] Applying this divide to my own research, education and freedom of expression INGOs might decide to work in an authoritarian regime either because (1) they believe that doing so will improve the lives of citizens in that country and hold the government accountable, or (2) they hope that doing so will raise global awareness of their own pet issues, create positive public relations and press coverage, and increase donations. 

To overcome this divide and provide a more unified theory of INGO behavior, @MitchellSchmitz:2014 present their own theory of "principled instrumentalism." Based on an impressive analysis of 152 US-registered INGOs, they argue that INGOs *are* driven largely by their principles, and that the economic, political, and competitive dynamics that other scholars have mistakenly taken as behavioral drivers serve as constraints to this principled behavior. That is, "organisations instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 489]. 

Unlike states or firms that generally face singular goals, like maximizing national security or maximizing profits, INGOs face a tradeoff between mission and money and must pursue both simultaneously. Mitchell and Schmitz present an elegant formal model to demonstrate how INGO effectiveness is a function of its mission, fundraising income, fundraising expenditures, and its budget. Organizations thus pursue different mixes of mission programming and fundraising income, subject to external constraints over time. Correspondingly, it is likely that INGOs initially decide to get involved in an authoritarian country because of normative concerns, but then must balance external pressures that can reverse those decisions. For example, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has been involved in several legal cases for imprisoned bloggers and activists, but only in a handful of Middle Eastern nations—it is likely that government restrictions or limited funding confine what they are able to do and shape their strategies in responding to needs. Similarly, it is possible that INGOs focused on primary education are unwilling to get involved in authoritarian nations that place heavy restrictions on foreign funding, opting instead to place their limited resources in nations where they can get they biggest "bang for their humanitarian buck."


# Methods
ensemble of quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze different aspects of the argument - cross-country statistical analysis + survey research + interviews, not for triangulation but to build towards a larger argument (Seawright's thing) 

Summarize whole sectors - use YIO (start with RWB or CPJ and go crazy with "Relations with Non-Governmental Organizations") + IssueCrawler to get as many organizations as possible (Communication / Press subjects + Education subjects). That will let me survey the sectors.

BeautifulSoup the XML or HTML, or try a special YIO request if I count as a member?

First map out the network, saving URLs as I go. Then go back and download all the content (that way I don't over-download; I only want organizations that are in that topic, not big magnets like Amnesty. Also, put a limit on the network crawling thing so that it doesn't look for nodes for organizations that aren't in the right subject?)

Get count of where INGOs have members (common thing: https://worldpolity.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/child-rights-ingo-membership-data/)

Use INGO membership to predict (or at least correlate with) autocratic survival in general, ME + China specifically, copying Andrea Kendall-Taylor and Erica Frantz

> In the course of arguing for principled instrumentalism, @MitchellSchmitz:2014 criticize existing studies of INGOs as being too focused on a handful of prominent organizations, resulting in findings and theories that are likely not very generalizable. For example, @Wong:2012 looks primarily at Amnesty International,^[Along with a ton of other people. People love to study Amnesty.] while @Stroup:2012 looks at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), CARE International, and Oxfam UK. Other INGO scholars have leveled similar critiques [@BloodgoodSchmitz:2013]. Mitchell and Schmitz recognize the utility of these in-depth case studies, but argue that more must be done—these case studies should be combined with large, more representative analyses to better understand the organizations that work in specific issue areas as a whole. @Kelley:2012 and @Buthe:2011 do this well, looking at the election monitoring INGO sector and the world of standards setting as a whole while also including more detailed studies of selected cases from those sectors. Judith's ongoing human trafficking work follows a similar pattern, surveying a broad swatch of the human trafficking INGO sector.
> 
> I plan to follow a similar approach. I will create a comprehensive database of all the INGOs that work in each of the two issue areas and conduct a sector-wide analysis likely through a survey, combined with other data collected on my own, like information from these organizations' 990 returns (if based in the US). I will then select 2–3 organizations from each sector as detailed cases and conduct archival research and semistructured interviews with their staff and management (ideally traveling to DC, London, Salt Lake City, and elsewhere as needed). 
> 
> Rather than focus my analysis on these INGOs in general, I plan on pegging my analysis to specific events. For example, I want to track different INGO responses to specific journalist arrests or specific humanitarian disasters (like earthquakes, landslides, etc.). Combining events with a list of all INGOs involved in each sector will allow me to create counterfactuals—using a list of the "usual suspects" I can identify which did or did not respond to specific needs (and which ones ordinarily would have), thus allowing me to investigate why. 
> 
> In addition to quantitative analysis of survey results and qualitative analysis of interviews, I can also augment my research with fancier methods like text-based computational text analysis (perhaps to look at large troves of archival material), agent-based modeling (to test the mathematical and game theoretical implications of my theory), or event data analysis since I have experience with them. 






> LDS Charities—the official humanitarian wing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons)—has long struggled to obtain permission to legally provide its humanitarian services in several regions of the world. The organization offers a variety of services, including neonatal resuscitation training, wheelchair delivery, eye exams, disaster relief, and direct assistance to local orphanages, leprosariums, and medical centers, but its legal status is often ambiguous. Beginning in the early 1990s, the LDS Church worked with Egypt's now-former president Hosni Mubarak to allow LDS Charities to formally register as a foreign charity. Year after year, President Mubarak would signal his approval, with the caveat that his Coptic Christian council would ultimately have the final say. However, this council regularly denied all requests for legalization until finally conceding in 2007. Why did Mubarak, an ostensibly omnipotent dictator, defer to his Christian advisors? He had the legal right to approve the request on his own, and given that Egypt was not a democracy, there was arguably little need show deference for such a small decision.

> Mubarak used LDS Charities and other humanitarian INGOs as pawns in domestic politics. Coptic Christians account for 10–15% of Egypt's population and are both politically active and fearful of persecution. By giving Coptic leaders some say in trivial decisions, Mubarak could, in a way, placate them and help maintain the stability of his regime. Copts, in turn, appeared threatened by foreign Christian groups that could change the balance of Eastern Christian dominance in the country, and thus did not want more Western Christian organizations to work in the country.
