	International NGOs have long been instrumental in promoting universal human rights and providing humanitarian relief and assistance. However, the unique political dynamics of authoritarianism shape the programs, advocacy, and services that these INGOs provide in their target countries, potentially leading to changes in programming to accommodate the regulations and restrictions dictators impose on them. As they do with other pseudo-democratic institutions, authoritarian regimes use INGOs and their services for a variety of self-interested reasons, including enhancing their regime's longevity and stability, boosting their international reputation, receiving policy guidance and assistance, or increasing their control over the population.

    Because INGOs are based in foreign countries and are generally free to exit at will, dictators have a limited menu of policy options for controlling the international organizations that operate within their country. Regimes will constrict or expand regulations on INGOs based primarily on domestic political factors, but also in part based on the issues pursued by the INGOs. In turn, INGOs respond to dictators' regulations in a variety of ways, ranging from compliance to outright antagonism. This response is determined in part by the amount of operational and organizational flexibility the INGO has, based on the INGO's ideological leanings, the variety and the quantity of programs the INGO pursues in the country, and the strength of the connections the INGO and other organizations and states.



At the same time, these improvements have not led to increased democratization (as predicted?) - improvement in services, no improvement in political structure. Authoritarianism appears as established and stable as ever, even in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring

This is because of a new type of authoritarianism - called hybrid, competitive, previously thought of as an exception to the rule - but they're not exceptions—this is the standard form of authoritarianism today. Dictators use pseudo democratic institutions to stay in power. Elections, etc. BUT ALSO, interestingly, INGOs. Show graph from article + my added INGO data.

In my dissertation, I intend to argue that INGOs are used as an instrument for authoritarian survival. This has implications for INGOs that work in dictatorships, as it can affect the programs and services these organizations offer.

INGO behavior influenced by lots of stuff - networks, internal structure, home institutional environment, BUT ALSO the countries that they work in. 

INGO programming changes because of authoritarian survival strategies.

I will use an ensemble of methods to argue this…

## International NGO behavior

Established now that pseudo-democratic institutions let dictators stay in power. Participation in IGOs?

Working with INGOs, though? What about non-state actors?

Given the potential influence INGOs have in authoritarian regimes…

Boomerangs and spirals…

When will INGOs get involved in a country? Do they have to balance any normative concerns of regime repression with their principles, missions, and values?

Studying INGOs themselves, rather than the countries they work in and the regimes they work with (or against), remains an understudied area of IR. Part of the reason for this is because INGOs have unique organizational challenges and are thus difficult to research. Previous research has found that INGOs are driven by a set of normative principles and work to force states "toward normative convergence and international cooperation" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 488].^[See also the host of literature based on @Keck:1998.] Others have found that INGOs instead behave as firms in a competitive market, driven by instrumental concerns of survival and strategy.^[See @Cooley:2002; @Bob:2002; among others.] Applying this divide to my own research, education and freedom of expression INGOs might decide to work in an authoritarian regime either because (1) they believe that doing so will improve the lives of citizens in that country and hold the government accountable, or (2) they hope that doing so will raise global awareness of their own pet issues, create positive public relations and press coverage, and increase donations. 

To overcome this divide and provide a more unified theory of INGO behavior, @MitchellSchmitz:2014 present their own theory of "principled instrumentalism." Based on an impressive analysis of 152 US-registered INGOs, they argue that INGOs *are* driven largely by their principles, and that the economic, political, and competitive dynamics that other scholars have mistakenly taken as behavioral drivers serve as constraints to this principled behavior. That is, "organisations instrumentally pursue their principled objectives within the economic constraints and political opportunity structures imposed by their external environments" [@MitchellSchmitz:2014, 489]. 

Unlike states or firms that generally face singular goals, like maximizing national security or maximizing profits, INGOs face a tradeoff between mission and money and must pursue both simultaneously. Mitchell and Schmitz present an elegant formal model to demonstrate how INGO effectiveness is a function of its mission, fundraising income, fundraising expenditures, and its budget. Organizations thus pursue different mixes of mission programming and fundraising income, subject to external constraints over time. Correspondingly, it is likely that INGOs initially decide to get involved in an authoritarian country because of normative concerns, but then must balance external pressures that can reverse those decisions. For example, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has been involved in several legal cases for imprisoned bloggers and activists, but only in a handful of Middle Eastern nations—it is likely that government restrictions or limited funding confine what they are able to do and shape their strategies in responding to needs. Similarly, it is possible that INGOs focused on primary education are unwilling to get involved in authoritarian nations that place heavy restrictions on foreign funding, opting instead to place their limited resources in nations where they can get they biggest "bang for their humanitarian buck."


# Methods

ensemble of quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze different aspects of the argument - cross-country statistical analysis + survey research + interviews, not for triangulation but to build towards a larger argument (Seawright's thing) 

Summarize whole sectors - use YIO (start with RWB or CPJ and go crazy with "Relations with Non-Governmental Organizations") + IssueCrawler to get as many organizations as possible (Communication / Press subjects + Education subjects). That will let me survey the sectors.

BeautifulSoup the XML or HTML, or try a special YIO request if I count as a member?

First map out the network, saving URLs as I go. Then go back and download all the content (that way I don't over-download; I only want organizations that are in that topic, not big magnets like Amnesty. Also, put a limit on the network crawling thing so that it doesn't look for nodes for organizations that aren't in the right subject?)

Get count of where INGOs have members (common thing: https://worldpolity.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/child-rights-ingo-membership-data/)

Use INGO membership to predict (or at least correlate with) autocratic survival in general, ME + China specifically, copying Andrea Kendall-Taylor and Erica Frantz

 
Rather than focus my analysis on these INGOs in general, I plan on pegging my analysis to specific events. For example, I want to track different INGO responses to specific journalist arrests or specific humanitarian disasters (like earthquakes, landslides, etc.). Combining events with a list of all INGOs involved in each sector will allow me to create counterfactuals—using a list of the "usual suspects" I can identify which did or did not respond to specific needs (and which ones ordinarily would have), thus allowing me to investigate why. 

In addition to quantitative analysis of survey results and qualitative analysis of interviews, I can also augment my research with fancier methods like text-based computational text analysis (perhaps to look at large troves of archival material), agent-based modeling (to test the mathematical and game theoretical implications of my theory), or event data analysis since I have experience with them.
