Recent work in political science and international relations has attempted to explain two significant puzzles: the internal workings of authoritarian politics and the international influence of non-state actors. Contrary to conventional wisdom, scholars such as @Blaydes:2011, @LevitskyWay:2010, and @GandhiPrzeworski:2007 have argued that modern authoritarian regimes adopt quasi-democratic political institutions such as free elections, an independent judiciary, or civil society in ways that seem "wrong" to democratically minded Western observers. This research has shown that authoritarians delegate authority to these institutions in part to maintain their own power, offsetting domestic pressure and boosting their internal reputation. 

A separate literature has sought to open the black box of transnational civil society behavior, demonstrating that contrary to the popular idea that civil society can serve as the moral bulwark of the global system, international non-government organizations (INGOs) are strategic actors that follow their own agendas. In particular, they are susceptible to a host of internal and external pressures and influences, including the institutional environments of countries they are based in [@Stroup:2012], the global demand for their advocated issue [@Bob:2002; @Bob:2005; @Carpenter:2014], or their internal managerial structure [@Wong:2012]. 

However, little research has attempted to combine these two disparate theoretical developments, analyzing (1) the role of transnational civil society (and other non-state actors) *within* authoritarian regimes and (2) the influence these regimes can have *on* those transnational actors (and vice versa). Why do self-interested autocrats allow these domestic and international civil society organizations to exist or operate in their borders? What do these organizations do in authoritarian regimes? How are INGOs influenced by pressures from authoritarian regimes? Can domestic civil society influence reforms within their home states if an autocrat can control their activities? Can transnational civil society organizations influence policy reforms in authoritarian nations, and if so, how? 

In this review, I propose that by combining different theoretical approaches to domestic and transnational civil society, we can analyze the role of civil society in authoritarian regimes with much more nuance. This added complexity can provide answers to many questions as to why authoritarian leaders willingly cede power and authority to domestic and international challengers. Ultimately, approaching the relationship between INGOs, domestic NGOs, and authoritarian regimes using institutional theory paves the way for future research into the causal mechanisms behind effective transnational activism. Figure 1 provides a broad visual overview of my argument. 

![Overview of argument](Figures/figure1.pdf)

I first argue institutional theory—in particular the perspective of new institutional economics—can and should be applied to civil society. Because civil society can provide a focal point for collective action against recalcitrant or oppressive governments, these theories (typically applied to more traditional institutions such as constitutions or legislatures) allow us to see civil society as a strategic actor in a bidirectional relationship to the ruling regime. Any political institution (civil society included) can either act independently or be acted upon by the regime, depending on the dynamics of its relationship to the regime. I use a rich literature on authoritarianism to demonstrate how autocrats attempt to navigate these pressures. Authoritarians can attempt to capture or co-opt civil society organizations *or* allow them to operate pluralistically, depending on whether those organizations have outside assistance or domestic prominence and power. 

I then show that actors in the international arena, including foreign states and non-state actors (and transnational civil society specifically), also act as institutional pressures on an authoritarian regime that can play a significant role in its domestic politics, in spite of contrary realist theories. As with domestic actors, these international actors engage in a bidirectional relationship with the regime and can either (1) be used by the state to bolster its stability and legitimacy or (2) impose actual pressure for normative policy changes within the regime. However, because of the added complexity dynamics within and between authoritarian states and the international arena, INGOs face three dilemmas when confronting sovereign authoritarian states: (1) the necessity to link with domestic civil society inside target states distorts the market for advocacy and charity work, (2) endogenous dynamics within transnational civil society affect the sector's effectiveness, and (3) as with their domestic counterparts, authoritarian regimes will attempt to limit, co-opt, or capture transnational civil movements for their own purposes.

I conclude with brief thoughts about the application of this complex literature to future research agendas. 


# An institutional approach to domestic civil society

The idea of a civil society has long been salient in political science, with commentators as early as De Tocqueville theorizing on the importance of groups of citizens that actively engage with their governments to advocate for reform, rights, change, and other services. Civil society is traditionally defined as "an agglomeration of private, voluntary organizations that have the capacity to assert the rights of individuals and groups," [@Cook:2007, 143] and is most commonly operationalized as non-governmental organizations (NGOs),^[Though it is important to note that NGOs do not represent all of civil society; that is, all NGOs are civil society organizations, but not all civil society organizations are NGOs [@Yerkes:2012, 18].] or organizations that operate outside of both the private and public sectors, ostensibly filling social gaps left by firms and governments [@AhmedPotter:2006, 30; see also @Hansmann:1980]. Civil society need not be explicitly political or rights-focused—any sort of association, including bowling clubs and parent/teacher associations, allows citizens to come in contact with each other, build social capital, and aggregate individual preferences [@Putnam:1994].

Given this wide range of possible civil society organizations, ranging from neighborhood book clubs to international human rights advocacy NGOs, there has been a lack of a unified theoretical framework for approaching civil society. To address this, I propose that by looking at civil society through an institutionalist lens, we can gain significant analytic and theoretical insight into its purpose and functions. While formal institutional theory has typically been applied to more traditional institutions such as constitutions, electoral systems, legislative committee assignments, or judiciary structures, these theories can be usefully applied to non-traditional political phenomena like civil society. In particular, institutional theory allows us to see how civil society as an institution lowers transaction costs and promotes coordinated collective action against or in support of the state. 

Simply put, institutions are the collection of rules that define the parameters of social activity, or the "humanly devised constraints that shape human interactions" [@North:1990, 3]. These "rules of the game" dictate who can make decisions, which actions are allowed or prohibited, and how obedience is rewarded and disobedience punished [@Ostrom:1990, 51]. Institutions can range from formal structures like constitutions and property ownership regimes to informal social and cultural norms, practices, and traditions. Ultimately, institutions—both formal and informal—gain traction in society because they reduce the transaction costs of social and economic interaction. When players interact, they can trust that their counterparts will behave appropriately because of the rules of the underlying institutional framework.^[This trust can also be described in game theoretic terms as a state of equilibrium, where institutional arrangements structure the payoffs such that players have little incentive to move [@Weingast:1997; @Greif:2004; @Calvert:1995].] 

Treating civil society as an institution yields the greatest theoretical advantage when considering how civil society organizations and NGOs lower transaction costs by solving difficult collective action problems and public goods dilemmas. Civil society has typically been defined in one of two ways.^[Defined as "Civil Society I" and "Civil Society II" by @FoleyEdwards:1996.] The first school of thought, championed by @Putnam:1994, holds that vibrant associational life forges links that cross social boundaries—bowling clubs, parent/teacher associations, neighborhood groups, volunteer organizations, and other nonprofit groups tend to include members from multiple social strata, thereby breaking down vertical social boundaries and increasing social trust. This associational life increases civic engagement, embeds norms of reciprocity into society, and helps improve democratic governance—in other words, civil society ultimately *strengthens and bolsters* the state.^[Antonio Gramsci offers a bleaker view, arguing that civil society actually contributes to "a more subtle and sophisticated form of state power"—one that "serves as an outer perimeter of defense for a hegemonic state" [@Cook:2007, 7, 143].]

In contrast, others have argued that civil society should stand *in opposition to* the state. The deeper social connections formed by participating in associational life can allow members of these organizations to "stand up to city hall" [@Jamal:2007, 4], to pursue their community self-interests, or to help maintain moral order and social norms. In this view, civil society organizations act as watchdogs against the government (or private sector), providing members of society with a focal point for popular mobilization. While discussing the institutional foundation for public morality—norms that shape the preferences and payoffs for players in a society—Platteau argues:

> A civil society helps to back trust whenever there is a sufficient number of citizens who feel vengeful enough to work towards exposing publicly the illegal acts or malpractices of both private and state agents, and towards bringing enough pressure to sanction them even though such actions entail significant costs to themselves (by denouncing economic crimes they produce a public good) [@Platteau:2000, 308].

The fact that the denouncement of grievances is a public good is key to civil society's role as a social focal point. @Ostrom:1990 convincingly argues that social norms (defined as institutions) allow communities to police and regulate common-pool resources—rival but non-excludable goods that behave similar to more traditional public goods. To prevent overfishing, communities of Turkish fishermen developed detailed social norms to dictate where fishing is permissible on which days by which fishermen. Without those norms, an aggrieved fisherman whose area on a lake is depleted by a rival has no recourse; with these norms, the fisherman has recourse to social shaming, stigma, and compensation. Similarly, a single aggrieved citizen alone cannot directly challenge the state or a firm with much efficacy. However, institutional structures allow them to address those grievances, thus providing a public good of engagement with the state. 

@Weingast:1997 provides a more general explanation of how institutions can provide this public good, arguing that institutions prevent rulers from infringing on the rights of their citizens by organizing a "coordinated understanding" of the violation of those rights and allowing citizens to more easily coordinate and respond to potential abuses. That is, when citizens face government abuse, they face a coordination dilemma—they must convince other citizens to band with them to seek redress against the government, which is often difficult. Institutions solve this coordination dilemma in two ways: (1) institutions such as constitutions, legal structures, and civil society provide mechanisms that allow citizens to initially seek redress (e.g. an aggrieved citizen has a constitutional right to sue the government; nonprofit organizations are legally allowed to provide community services the government may be unable to deliver, etc.), and (2) those institutions generate a coordinated understanding—or the expectation that something must and shall be done to address government abuses—among a nation's citizens [@Weingast:1997, 262]. Non-aggrieved citizens assist those who are victims of government abuse because (1) there are institutions in place that allow for redress, and (2) the citizens who are not victims expect that the current victims will come to their aid in the future. Because of this ability to rally popular support for collective action, civil society can be seen as a critical watchdog against government and private sector abuses and thereby protect citizens against the state.

However, I argue that it is possible to move beyond the normative debates over these two extremes of civil society skepticism (that it serves only to build the state) and civil society utopianism (that it serves only to protect against the state) and instead treat civil society as simply an institutional vehicle for coordinating collective action. A key implication of this argument is that the relationship between institutions within a state is rarely unidirectional—any political institution can either act independently or be acted upon by other institutions, such as the ruling regime, legislature, or private sector. As an institution, civil society can exert influence on a regime, pressuring and shaming it to follow specific norms. Conversely, civil society can also be directed, co-opted, or controlled by the state to help ensure a regime's survival. 


# Political institutions in authoritarian regimes

Having established that domestic civil society can be treated as a political institution just like constitutions, legislatures, or judiciary systems, we can use institutional theory to analyze its role and position within a state. Institutional collective action organized through coordinated understanding can occur in support of the state *or* in opposition to it—or both simultaneously. In democracies, civil society can (and should) play both roles, allowing citizens to participate in governance while also allowing them to address collective grievances suffered because of government policies or overreach. In fact, democratic stability depends on this institutional equilibrium: political officials must "respect democracy's limits on their behavior" [@Weingast:1997, 245]—limits imposed not only by legal checks and balances, but by citizens coordinated through civil society organizations.

Political institutions behave differently under authoritarianism, where rulers are not beholden to democratic norms. This difference is most easily seen in elections—the quintessential form of democratic political collective action—where autocrats manipulate electoral results overtly.^[Most recently Syria's Bashar al-Assad was re-elected with the approval of 88.7% of the electorate, while Egypt's new president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, won with 93.3% of the votes cast.] Authoritarian regimes today appear to rely on political institutions with the sole intent of bolstering the state. However, while the relationship between the regime and external institutions appears unidirectional, deeper analysis shows that political institutions can influence the regime's stability. 

## Democratization and authoritarian persistence

Overreliance on the idea of civil society utopianism—that civil society will ultimately lead to democratization—has implications that reach far beyond mere theoretical debates. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and other nations placed civil society at the center of democratization and development policies in part because of this optimism. During the so-called third wave of democratization in the 1990s, policymakers considered any country moving away from dictatorship to be moving teleologically toward democracy, and that ultimately, every country could successfully transition to democratic rule [@Carothers:2002]. Civil society was seen as a powerful engine of this transitory process that, if grown and strengthened in oppressive societies, would ultimately push a country along the path to democracy and result in the decline of authoritarianism. 

Despite all the attention and money civil society development policies have garnered, authoritarianism has persisted. In 2002 fewer than 20% of the world's autocracies were on the "right track" of democratization [@Carothers:2002, 9]—the rest had stalled or failed to move along the path at all, despite a rapid growth of ostensibly democratic institutions like constitutional reforms, elections, and opposition parties. Instead of remaining strictly autocratic, most dictatorships today have evolved into an undefinable regime type—authoritarianism with attributes of democratic governance, but clearly not pluralistic democracy. Throughout the world, it appears that dictators have managed to elude the intended consequences of continued Western democratization efforts. Even dramatic events such as the Arab Spring have largely resulted in persistent autocracy, in spite of millions of dollars in civil society development aid given to Egypt, Tunisia, and other Arab nations.^[USAID and the US State Department spent more than $86 million on civil society assistance in Egypt from 2008–13 alone, according to [http://www.foreignassistance.gov](http://www.foreignassistance.gov).]

Multiple theories have been developed in the past decade to explain authoritarian resilience, including "feckless pluralism," [@Carothers:2002] where a regime purposely creates a shallow democracy to stay in power; and "stalled democracy," [@Bellin:2002] where a regime consciously pits rival institutions (such as labor and capital) against each other to head off actual democratic development. These theories provide compelling explanations for how autocrats have been able to remain in power despite the presence of seemingly democratic institutions, and have led to advances in operationalizations of regime type. For example, instead of assigning a simple dichotomous outcome of autocracy or democracy, most popular regime measurements use a scale, such as Polity IV's -10 to 10 scale^[With regime types ranging from autocracies (-10 to -6), anocracies (-5 to 5), to democracies (6 to 10)] or the Unified Democracy Score's -2 to 2 scale [@PemsteinMeserveMelton:2010].^[This measure uses Bayesian estimation and simulation to generate aggregate democracy scores, but no labels are assigned—higher scoring countries are more democratic.] However, these scores often do not capture the complexities of the continuum—just because a regime holds elections or defers to a legislature (institutional developments that would boost a country's democracy score) does not necessarily indicate democratic growth or transition. As will be shown, seemingly democratic institutions work differently within more autocratic regimes.

These new approaches face two theoretical shortcomings. First, embedded within these theories is the idea that democracy is still the best normative outcome for a regime and that if a country is not yet democratic, they will eventually transition (or at least make improvements in the Polity IV scale). Even the names of the theories belie this democratic normativity: a "stalled democracy" is simply a regime that got stuck along the way to democracy, while "feckless pluralism" implies that a regime uses democratic institutions in a perverse way—that these autocrats are simply "doing democracy wrong."

Second, these theories mistakenly give the impression that authoritarian regimes are monolithic, omnipotent, and omniscient actors in control of all political actors within their states—that these regimes masterfully select which democratic institutions to allow or prohibit with no adverse consequences or possibilities that the actors (i.e. activists, legislators, judges) in these institutions have their own agency. In reality, however, the relationship of power between the regime and other institutions is not unidirectional, and regimes are surprisingly susceptible to external institutional pressures.

## Unconventional authoritarian political institutions

A growing literature on the nuances of autocracy has begun to address these limitations, showing that authoritarianism is not simply a transitional phase before democracy, but an altogether distinct regime type where autocrats must carefully balance external actors and institutions to remain in power [@LevitskyWay:2010]. This newer theoretical strain emphasizes the fact that authoritarians are often very precariously positioned—regimes can collapse if they are unable to balance their rivals [@Heiss:2012; @Svolik:2009]. In this view, authoritarianism is a complex multi-level game played by the regime, elites, the opposition, international actors, activists, and social movements (see Figure 2). Instead of looking at a monolithic autocrat who rules over everything in the polity with impunity, authoritarianism becomes a dynamic form of governance, with constant legislative, constitutional, and institutional reforms [@Stacher:2012, 31].

![Institutional dynamics within authoritarian regimes](Figures/figure2.pdf)

Political institutions lie at the core of the theory of competitive authoritarianism. An autocrat interested in maintaining power over their population without turning to absolute totalitarianism can either (1) outlaw opposition to their policies through political repression, or (2) improve the popularity of their policies by manufacturing political loyalty [@Wintrobe:1990]. Institutions are the primary mechanism for both of these strategies. Autocrats can create narrow institutions like consultative councils and executive cabinets to give voice to elites and build patronage. Regimes can also create democratic-appearing institutions like legislatures, elections, or civil society to create popular loyalty and mitigate threats from society or the opposition [@Gandhi:2006; @GandhiPrzeworski:2007]. In either case, if "rulers counter [threats to their rule] with an adequate degree of institutionalization, they survive in power" [@GandhiPrzeworski:2007, 284]. Ultimately, the persistence or collapse of authoritarian regimes depends on the quality and management of their institutional restraints and rivals [@Brownlee:2007, 202], not the magnitude of repression or violence against their citizens.

Because it is infeasible and costly to rely solely on violent oppression to maintain power, autocrats typically allow for a degree of institutional dissonance and competition [@Brumberg:2002]. However, this devolution of control to third parties—many of which can be actively opposed to the regime—creates an interesting competitive dynamic. If the political institutions in a regime are competitive enough, opponents and activists can use them as a means for obtaining actual power within the government. Under this form of competitive authoritarianism, there is genuine competition for power through elections, though the playing field is generally skewed toward the incumbents [@LevitskyWay:2010]. Political competition under authoritarianism is "real but unfair" [@LevitskyWay:2010, 5]—but still real. Efforts to influence, control, or diminish opposing institutions can often backfire, highlighting the bidirectional relationship between the regime and external actors.

Under competitive authoritarianism, there is a wide variety of institutional actors that can either put pressure on and act against the regime or be co-opted and used by the regime. A state can intentionally nurture domestic private capital and labor groups to enhance economic development, but doing so poses the risk of creating social forces capable of challenging the state. To counter this, the state can structure political and economic incentives to ensure that these potential catalysts of opposition remain tied to the state and do not pursue democratization [@Bellin:2002]. However, these groups can still wield power—state-sponsored labor unions were some of the most active anti-government protesters in Egypt and Tunisia in the 2011 uprisings [@Beinin:2011]. Autocrats can also adopt traditional democratic institutions such as legislatures and elections as a way to balance external forces. For example, Egypt has held competitive parliamentary elections for decades, but not with the purpose of giving citizens representation in government. Instead, Nasser, Sadat, and Mubarak used elections to dole out patronage to politicians who proved their loyalty through competitive elections, thus mediating (or prolonging) distributional conflict between the lower elites who could theoretically oppose the regime [@Blaydes:2011]. Again, parliaments in authoritarian regimes are not simply passive institutions that willingly allowed themselves to be used—opposition groups like the Muslim Brotherhood used competitive parliamentary elections to their advantage and regularly won large proportions of seats [@Wickham:2002]. These groups' political success allowed them to more effectively mobilize popular support against the regime and was a major factor in the Muslim Brotherhood's victory in the 2012 Egyptian presidential election.^[Two other examples usefully illustrate this bidirectionality of seemingly democratic institutions under authoritarianism: public protests and government accountability. Authoritarians can permit nationalist anti-foreign protests to credibly signal their intentions during international crises—in effect using popular anger to increase regime stability in the international arena. However, these protests can spin out of control as opposition elites co-opt the protests, thus backfiring and destabilizing the regime [@Weiss:2013]. Initiatives to increase authoritarian accountability to the public can also backfire—legislators in authoritarian regimes who are legally required to disclose their political activities and finances become less outspoken of the government and are less likely to be reelected or receive regime patronage [@MaleskySchulerTran:2012].]

## Civil society in authoritarian regimes

Despite the calls for civil society utopianism in democratic transitions, civil society's institutional purpose and role within autocracies has been largely undertheorized. I argue that we can gain significant insight into the dynamics of civil society within autocracies if we treat it as yet another political institution that regimes must balance, akin to capital, labor, legislatures, or social movements. @Yerkes:2012 provides a nascent analytical approach to the regime–civil society relationship that can help situate future work on civil society *qua* institution. She argues that autocratic regimes face a menu of three options when facing political pressure from civil society: (1) *capture*, where the state takes control over either specific NGOs or the entire civil society sector, (2) *co-optation*, where the state strategically uses independent NGOs for its own purposes, and (3) *pluralism*, where the state allows NGOs to operate without government intervention.

Authoritarian regimes have two general approaches to capture civil society institutions within their countries. First, rulers can create their own parallel NGOs within the civil society sector to crowd out more independent organizations. These government operated NGOs (GONGOs) are typically lead by first ladies [@Heydemann:2007] or close regime allies [@Stacher:2012, 79] who use the organizations as platforms to explicitly support the government, often giving the regime a humanitarian veneer. These organizations tend to deal with apolitical issues that attract global attention and praise, such as "service provision, education, training, sports, [and] youth development," [@Heydemann:2007, 8] as well as issues affecting women and children. For example, as the former head of the National Council of Women and the Suzanne Mubarak Women's International Peace Movement, the former Egyptian first lady gained wide international praise for her humanitarian and social efforts [@Yerkes:2012, 22]. Similarly, Jordan's Queen Rania has launched dozens of initiatives and GONGOs focused on childhood education, women's issues, and refugee support, also to much praise [@Carapico:2002, 392]. While these GONGOs can engage in important humanitarian work, they also permit the regime to siphon domestic and international funding away from the independent civil society sector—essentially allowing the ruler to intercept donations and weaken domestic civil society organizations. 

Second, the regime can take outright control over the civil society sector or impose strict limitations on its activity. In December 2012, Egypt's former President Morsi announced new legislation that would nationalize all civil society organizations and treat them as part of the Social Affairs Ministry. NGO staff would be considered civil servants and would fall under complete control of the government.^["NGOs reject draft law to nationalize civil society," *Egypt Independent*, April 12, 2012, [http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/ngos-reject-draft-law-nationalization-civil- society](http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/ngos-reject-draft-law-nationalization-civil- society).] Though this proposal was tabled, new legislation was passed in early 2013 that prohibited NGOs from participating in political activities, required the retroactive registration of 40,000 organizations, and created additional bureaucratic hurdles to receive approval for most projects.^[Omar Halawa, "New draft law would limit the scope of work of NGOs," *Egypt Independent*, February 14, 2013, [http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/new-draft-law-would-limit-scope-work-ngos](http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/new-draft-law-would-limit-scope-work-ngos); Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies, "Strangling Civil Society with Repressive Laws: Morsi’s Bill to Nationalize Civic Activity Must be Retracted," February 7, 2013, [http://www.cihrs.org/?p=5875&lang=en](http://www.cihrs.org/?p=5875&lang=en).] Strong backlash from domestic and international human and civil rights groups has prevented the law from being fully implemented,^[The Egyptian government most recently backed down from another attempt at enforcing the law in August 2014: "Egypt delays deadline for criticized NGO registry," *The Associated Press*, August 31, 2014, [http://bigstory.ap.org/article/egypt-delays-deadline-criticized-ngo-registry](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/egypt-delays-deadline-criticized-ngo-registry).] but the law continues to threaten a partial capture of the civil society sector.

Co-optation is a more subtle form of state control. Instead of attempting to completely dominate civil society, the regime works to ensure that formal civil society organizations are vertically linked to the state's central authority. For example, in post-Oslo Palestine, hundreds of new associations and nonprofits appeared in the wake of the new peace process, but access to resources was limited by these organizations' connections to Yasser Arafat's ruling Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Palestinian associations that supported the PNA received more funding from the government and national donors. As such, many Palestinian association leaders built vertical networks linking their organizations to the state, rather than with members of the communities they served. In one instance, a sports club in Ramallah transformed into a community office linked directly to the PNA, allowing its members to access medical assistance and other unrelated benefits from the government. The PNA successfully insinuated itself into society and transformed civil society into a vertical patronage network [@Jamal:2007, 52–56]. Similar trends have occurred in other authoritarian regimes in the region. @Liverani:2008 argues that Algerian associational life was too closely linked to the ruling regime to have any impact on genuine democratization, while @Wiktorowicz:2000 and @Blaydes:2011 similarly show how Islamist political parties in Jordan and Egypt follow an almost identical pattern, changing their ideological agendas to gain political power within the authoritarian regime. Ultimately, co-optation is a "reorganization of existing structures of state authority" [@Marzouk:1997, 195] where civil society organizations become the "mediators between the people's demands and the administration's offers" [@Nefissa:2005, 8]—the state successfully institutionalizes NGOs as tools of regime stability.

Under capture and co-optation the relationship between the state and civil society is clearly unidirectional—NGOs and other civil society organizations become tools of the regime. Under pluralism, however, the relationship can be reversed (or at least neutralized) since NGOs are able to act more independently against the state. Gaining actual independence from state influence, however, is difficult—@Yerkes:2012 shows that advocacy organizations must have high levels of outside rhetorical support (i.e. foreign states or powerful transnational actors) to act as a buffer against state advances [-@Yerkes:2012, 73]. The most active and vocal opponents of Egypt's new NGO law have been organizations with clear links to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, both of which have issued formal condemnations of the law jointly with their Egyptian counterparts.^[See Human Rights Watch, "Egypt: New Draft Law an Assault on Independent Groups," May 30, 2013, [http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/30/egypt-new-draft-law-assault-independent-groups](http://www.hrw.org/news/2013/05/30/egypt-new-draft-law-assault-independent-groups) and Amnesty International, "Egypt Must End Attacks on Civil Society," March 1, 2012, [http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/egypt-must-end-attacks-civil-society-2012-03-01](http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/egypt-must-end-attacks-civil-society-2012-03-01), among others.] Organizations without those links tend to become co-opted or captured.

Pluralism does not necessarily favor civil society under authoritarianism. At times, permitting the development of a thick market of NGOs can help the regime balance potential threats. Often, "the sheer proliferation of small NGOS… [can make] 'divide and rule' easier" [@Brumberg:2002, 63], especially if those NGOs deal with apolitical issues. For example, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood filled critical gaps in social services during the 1990s, responding quickly to earthquakes, building collapses, and other humanitarian disasters. Though the Brotherhood was technically illegal, Mubarak tolerated this Islamic civil society sector as a way to consolidate his rule [@Wickham:2002, 103]—letting Brotherhood leaders spend their time with disaster relief could prevent them from turning to politics. However, Mubarak's decision to permit pluralism eventually backfired. As the Brotherhood provided social services, it became more popular politically, leading to electoral victories in parliament and, ultimately, Morsi's presidential victory following Mubarak's deposition.

&nbsp;

Ultimately, civil society institutions play a dynamic role in authoritarian regimes and are not simply window dressing. As with other political institutions, civil society aggregates social preferences and creates a focal point, or coordinated understanding, that allows citizens to engage with the state in a coordinated manner. However, it is important to not overstate civil society's potential to challenge the state, as authoritarian leaders can influence the sector to ensure regime stability. The relationship between the state and civil society is bidirectional—domestic NGOs can act as anti-government watchdogs or as enablers of the regime, depending on how strategic the state is in capturing or co-opting or how effective NGOs are at avoiding that influence.


# Sovereignty vs. interdependence: do non-state actors matter?

In many aspects, the relationship between domestic civil society and authoritarian regimes is surprisingly analogous to that of global or transnational civil society and sovereign nations. As with domestic civil society, transnational civil society organizations (and other similar non-state actors) are political institutions that help solve complex collective action problems within nations. In particular, transnational civil society can provide global regulatory and moral authority [@LipschutzFogel:2002], establishing rules, norms, and standards that states and firms can be expected to follow and that activists can rally behind. Additionally, both domestic and transnational civil society share a bidirectional relationship with ruling autocrats and can either act independently or be controlled or co-opted by the regime. However, because the relationship between non-state actors and the ruling regime transcends national boundaries and can conflict with notions of sovereignty, there are key differences in the dynamics of how transnational civil society and international NGOs (INGOs) relate to the state. At the foundation of these differences is a debate over whether non-state actors can even play a legitimate role in the international arena.

For decades, realism has been a useful theoretical framework for analyzing state behavior in the international system. In a realist view of the world, sovereign states seek power and security in an anarchical world that lacks coordinating institutions [@Keohane:1986]. Every intrastate interaction is rationally undertaken to improve a nation's position within this anarchy. As such, there is a hierarchy of issues, ranging from critical military and security policies (high politics) that help ensure the state's power in relation to its rivals, to more ancillary economic and social affairs (low politics) that do not have direct bearing on national power and position [@KeohaneNye:2001]. Because the sovereign nation is the key unit of analysis, states only interact with other states—neither international organizations like the UN nor domestic movements within states play a significant role. Northedge, an intellectual founder of realist theory, dismissed the notion of non-state actors having any important role in the international system, declaring that "the International Tiddlywinks Federation counted for little in a world of armed states" [quoted in @Halliday:2001, 21]. Indeed, in a world where states with militaries vie for power, unarmed non-state actors appear to have no practical purpose.

While states might not find the International Tiddlywinks Federation to be a threat, they do regularly engage with international organizations such as the UN, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund; with international NGOs like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International; and with private multinational firms like Apple. In contrast to the original realists who tended to ignore transnational organizations and domestic politics completely, neorealists today have acknowledged that these organizations *can* play an important role. However, states continue to reign supreme—transnational actors can only exist and have power if states allow them to. Countries that do not sign international treaties or allow non-state actors to operate are free from external authority. For example, the World Trade Organization (WTO) can only enforce its rulings and sanctions in member states, allowing non-member states to avoid WTO sanctions. States will only cede sovereignty to external institutions if doing so enhances national security, bolsters their power, or allows them to gain an advantage over rivals—all underlying dynamics of state-based realism. Transnational and international organizations are thus simply "creatures of national self-interest," subservient to the whims of the states who use them [@GordenkerWeiss:1996, 33–34].

![Complex interdependence](Figures/figure3.pdf)

However, states are rarely so omnipotent in their ability to control and balance other states, non-state actors, or their external environment. In contrast with realism, the theory of complex interdependence (a forerunner of constructivism) holds that any actor—state or non-state—can participate in global politics [@NyeKeohane:1971]. There is no hierarchy of issues within states; no distinction between high and low politics. Instead of pursuing strictly military and security agendas, states must confront a complex stew of domestic and international issues and actors (see Figure 3). Under complex interdependence, the international system is no longer a system of monolithic states, but instead a place where bureaucrats, legislators, judges, firms, civil society organizations, international organizations, and foreign states interact with each other domestically and internationally [@Slaughter:2004]. Sovereignty is no longer an absolute principle—regimes tend to be more porous, fragile, and open to external pressures.

Transnational civil society organizations and INGOs can act as powerful institutional pressures against and challenges to authoritarian regimes. Countries that receive negative evaluations in human rights INGO reports and press releases see a marked reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows [@BarryClayFlynn:2013] and tend to respond with better compliance to international human rights norms [@Murdie:2012]. The impact of non-state actors on state sovereignty is not limited to human rights shaming—hundreds of states have ceded their governing authority to complex private global regulatory regimes, adopting manufacturing, communication, and technological standards set by international organizations and private firms [@Buthe:2011]. Tight, intermestic networks of development NGOs and INGOs in countries with weak national governments can even marginalize the state: in South Asia and Eastern and Southern Africa, nations are far more dependent on aid than trade in part because of the activities of development INGOs [@Stiles:2002]. If we assume that a state's accession to non-state authority is a self-interested strategy to maintain the regime's authority and reputation, the impetus for reform does not come from rival states seeking to increase their own power. Governments do not typically direct INGO shaming campaigns or ISO technical standard negotiations in order to target other states—these movements to provide moral and regulatory authority are products of non-state actors. 

Realism and complex interdependence are two extremes of a continuum of state sovereignty, where states either masterfully control every event like a puppet master or where states are beholden to the behavior of a host of other actors. Truth lies somewhere between these theoretical poles. States are influenced by external actors—both domestic and foreign—and change their behavior in response to those pressures. At the same time, states act to protect their sovereignty and attempt to control or mitigate any external pressures. Analyzing non-state actors as institutional organizations that can act independently or under the influence of other actors provides an alternative approach to the debate between realism and interdependence and allows us to better understand the nuances of the relationships between transnational non-state actors, domestic movements, and ruling regimes.


# Boomerangs and spirals

Analyzing institutional behavior yields critical insights into the complex relationship between domestic civil society, transnational actors such as INGOs, and sovereign authoritarian regimes. Because states ostensibly exercise sovereignty within their borders, the motives and strategies of extraterritorial organizations are shaped by domestic regulations, movements, politics, and histories. Ultimately, "differences in domestic structures determine the variation in the policy impact of transnational actors" [@Tarrow:2001, 6]. For example, elite political preferences define which international issues will be adopted—laws in target countries that prohibit or limit domestic NGOs from receiving foreign funding or prevent INGOs from establishing field offices will limit INGO ability to pursue its mission within those countries. Additionally, INGOs must deal with local NGOs within the target country, which vary in the magnitude of their political power depending on their relationship with the state. Non-state actors interested in effecting policy reform must address and balance these domestic institutional factors using material incentives and normative pressure [@Kelley:2004], but each of these potential mechanisms is influenced by the political environment of the target country.

Though this relationship between states, INGOs, and domestic NGOs is complex and multilayered, two popular models have (rather successfully) attempted to disaggregate and explain the role of each class of actor. First, @Keck:1998 argue that INGOs and other transnational movements can work in concert with domestic NGOs to pressure and shame states that behave poorly. According to this theory, domestic advocacy NGOs that are restricted or blocked by their government will turn to allies in the international NGO community, who will in turn lobby their home states to convince international organizations like the UN to put high-level pressure on the offending regime, thereby creating an opening for the original domestic civil society organizations to advocate for policy changes. This relocation of advocacy power follows a boomerang pattern, moving from domestic NGOs to INGOs to foreign states and international organizations to domestic NGOs again. 

With repeated boomerang-like pressure from domestic NGOs and INGOs, responses to individual issues can evolve into human rights norms, resulting in the institutionalization of new policies and practices within an offending state. @RisseSikkink:1999 describe this process of norm socialization as a spiral, or a sequence of repeated boomerang effects. In the spiral model, domestic NGOs and opposition movements repeatedly turn to INGOs and transnational networks for help in their advocacy and slowly wear down the state. Initially the state denies the accusations of repression and claims that foreign human rights norms are invalid, but with repeated domestic and international pressure, the regime will begin to make concessions to the human rights network. Continued pressure helps formalize these concessions into actual legislation, and as politicians adhere to these policies (again because of domestic and international boomerang effects), they internalize the human rights norms that underpin the policies, thus resulting in long-lasting reform.

![Multilevel relationship between the regime, domestic civil society, and transnational organizations](Figures/figure4.pdf)

The boomerang and spiral models assume that INGOs will act as objective liaisons between domestic movements and international organizations or states. In their role as global moral police, INGOs should be able to address the most pressing and salient issues, providing any domestic opposition movement with the ability to access international assistance. Unfortunately this assumption is overly optimistic. Like any other institution, INGOs are strategic actors that pursue their own instrumental goals and agendas [@Risse:2010, 284] which are often at odds with the preferences of their home countries, international organizations, or the domestic NGOs they attempt to help (see Figure 4). As such, the issues that INGOs champion are often not those that are most deserving or urgent, but those that are most compatible with norms and culture of the target country and the preferences and political power of the INGOs themselves. Specifically, mismatches in issue adoption and INGO effectiveness occur because (1) the market for NGO and INGO advocacy is distorted by competition, and (2) internal, interactive, and institutional dynamics within INGOs shape the conditions and incentives for adopting specific issues.

## Distortions in the issue market

In their explanation of the spiral model, Risse and Ropp claim that "international norms are more likely to be implemented and complied with in the domestic context if they resonate or fit with existing collective understandings embedded in domestic institutions and political cultures" [-@RisseRopp:1999, 271]. This argument has broad implications for INGO issue selection. INGOs will be hesitant to take on policy and rights issues that do not resonate with the target country's existing political culture. No matter how deserving an issue may seem, the domestic environment has a powerful effect on the advocacy activities of both NGOs and INGOs. To gain support, domestic groups must reframe their issues to have better resonance with their international patrons [@Price:2003, 596]. However, in the process of reframing and chasing down scarce resources for their causes, domestic NGOs and INGOs adopt dysfunctional organizational behaviors, seeking government and donor rents, undermining potential allies, and turning away from their original missions [@Cooley:2002]. Bob dramatically summarizes this problem: 

> Despite its promise, today's 'global civil society' is for many a Darwinian arena in which the successful prosper but the weak wither. At any one time, there is room for only a few challengers on any issue. Tacitly and at times openly, needy groups vie with one another for the world’s sympathy, elevating themselves above their competitors and differentiating themselves from similar causes [-@Bob:2005, 8].

Advocacy NGOs that are experts at emotive marketing, employ native English speakers, use charismatic spokespeople, and craft their messages to fit Western sensibilities are far more effective at attracting INGO support than their competitors [@Bob:2002; @Bob:2005]. For example, in post-Soviet Russia, increased competition for democratization aid and links to INGOs led many NGOs to shift their missions from political advocacy to self-preservation. Instead of creating spiral-like pressure against the state, foreign democratization aid helped create a "professionalized realm of NGOs, inaccessible to most local groups and compromised by its links to a neoliberal vision of development" [@Hemment:2004, 215]. Quasi-experimental evidence from Kenya has also confirmed this effect: as domestic organizations look for external connections and funding, the leadership, membership, and missions of these organizations shift away from the constituencies they originally attempt to advocate for [@GugertyKremer:2008]. In the extreme, as domestic NGOs refine their issues and agendas to be more palatable to their INGO patrons, they can drift away from their constituencies and issues, becoming "lobbyists and politicians and not advocates" [@HulmeEdwards:1997, 20].

## Complexities within transnational civil society

In addition to the distortions associated with the market for advocacy and issue adoption, the boomerang and spiral models fail to account for dynamics within the transnational civil society sector and their effect on which issues become part of the global advocacy agenda. Various (1) internal, (2) interactive, and (3) institutional factors influence INGO effectiveness and issue adoption [@JohnsonHeiss:2014]. The internal managerial structure of an INGO help determine that organization's effectiveness. Organizations that successfully centralize proposal power (or the ability to propose new goals and missions) while decentralizing implementation power (or the ability to actually implement those proposals) are better able to pursue a unified agenda without stifling local creativity [@Wong:2012]. INGOs that fail to properly delegate these forms of power will struggle to adopt issues that are relevant to their target-country allies. Additionally, issues will gain more traction and influence within a target state if there are institutional complementarities between domestic and transnational NGOs [@Buthe:2011]—that is, if domestic NGOs are structured in a way that encourages engagement with international organizations, they will be able to establish fruitful alliances with transnational civil society and be more effective. 

The interactive relationships between INGOs also play a significant role in determining issue adoption. Organizations are most able to push new normative ideas onto the global agenda if they are connected to key nodes—or gatekeepers—in a network, who then vet the proposals and give (or deny) them credibility and legitimacy. In general, the more connected or centralized an INGO is in relation to other organizations, the more influential it will be [@Carpenter:2007; @Carpenter:2014]. As such, domestic issues championed by INGOs in less influential network positions will likely fail to cause a boomerang effect. 

Finally, beyond the influence of internal and interactive forces, an INGO's willingness to pursue particular issues and agendas is shaped by institutional factors. Despite their global scope, INGOs are based within states and are affected by those states' legal regulations, historical precedents, and cultural norms [@Stroup:2012]. For example, CARE USA's mission reflects American norms
of efficiency and results-oriented pragmatism by using a professional staff,
securing large amounts of government funding, and avoiding anti-American
advocacy. In contrast, Amnesty International, based in the United Kingdom,
eschews many of the stricter norms of business-like efficiency and
professionalization to focus more on advocacy work. These different home-country institutional environments have a direct impact on which issues these INGOs will choose to adopt—NGOs in authoritarian regimes that are more compatible with the home-country norms of INGOs will be more likely to receive boomerang-like support.

## Regime effects

Finally, the boomerang and spiral models fail to account for the influence of authoritarian domestic institutions on advocacy effectiveness. Risse and Ropp claim that the norm socialization process that results from the spiral model is universally generalizable and applicable to any type of regime [-@RisseRopp:1999, 239]. However, as discussed previously, political institutions in authoritarian states behave in unexpected ways. As with domestic civil society, autocrats have a bidirectional relationship with global civil society. INGOs can either act independently against the regime *or* be used or co-opted by the regime to maintain its power. However, relying on non-state actors for domestic stability is often fraught with risk—INGOs are wildcards within authoritarian regimes [@DeMars:2005]. 

Sovereign nations engage with international organizations and transnational civil society selectively, often depending on rational calculations of how that engagement might be beneficial to the regime. Authoritarian regimes in particular tend to follow international norms and allow INGO operations only when doing so "allows the regime to (1) shore up its authority and legitimacy and to (2) deflect international pressures" [@Hawkins:1997, 407–8, *numbers added*]. Autocrats can use INGOs and other non-state actors to stabilize and reinforce their political power at home. For example, because competition for foreign patronage created an absence of strong links between Russian advocacy groups and the public, the Russian state has been able to restructure the civil society sector so that only NGOs that "work on issues that align with the national interest" receive funding and support [@Henderson:2010, 254], short-circuiting international spiral pressure and silencing domestic advocacy movements. 

Authoritarian regimes will also use INGOs and other non-state actors to improve their international reputations. @Kelley:2012 argues that because election monitoring has become a global norm, governments—even those who fully intend on cheating and manipulating the election—permit election monitoring INGOs as a way of appearing credible and democratic to peer nations. To ensure that monitoring efforts do indeed improve the regime's reputation, authoritarian governments will try to circumvent international monitors or purposely invite friendly (or bribable) monitors to counterbalance more objective organizations. Because of this, election monitors can ultimately "contribute to the false legitimization of governments" [@Kelley:2012, 155]. 

These rational strategies have the potential to backfire, however, since authoritarians are rarely able to fully control all rival actors. Though inviting election monitors does provide substantial reputational benefits, the presence of high-quality monitors makes it more difficult to cheat and is associated with better election quality, fewer violations of electoral law, and more incumbent turnover [@Kelley:2012, 124]—rulers in competitive authoritarian regimes can lose monitored elections. In post-revolutionary Egypt, international human rights monitoring organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have benefitted from increased operational latitude as the different regimes have sought to bolster their international reputation. However, these organizations have issued dozens of reports condemning the government for its human rights abuses. Most recently, the executive director of Human Rights Watch was barred from entering the country following a detailed report into the military's massacre of Muslim Brotherhood protesters following Morsi's deposition last June.^["HRW chief denied entry to Egypt", Al-Jazeera, August 11, 2014, [http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/hrw-chief-denied-entry-egypt-201481164157675857.html](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/08/hrw-chief-denied-entry-egypt-201481164157675857.html); see also Human Rights Watch, "All According to Plan: The Rab'a Massacre and Mass Killings of Protesters in Egypt," August 12, 2014, [http://www.hrw.org/reports/2014/08/12/all-according-plan](http://www.hrw.org/reports/2014/08/12/all-according-plan).] Increased transnational oversight into Egyptian human rights has inadvertently led to increased international shaming and condemnation.

&nbsp;

In many regards, the relationship between authoritarian regimes and non-state actors like transnational civil society parallels that of the regime and domestic NGOs. Though transnational civil society organizations can exert influence on recalcitrant regimes and effect domestic policy reforms, they are as susceptible to capture and co-optation as their domestic counterparts. In addition to protecting against authoritarian capture, INGOs and other transnational organizations face distortions in the market for advocacy activities and internal dynamics that influence issue adoption and organizational effectiveness. 


# Avenues for future research

The relationship between authoritarian regimes, domestic civil society, and transnational actors is complex and multifaceted. Regimes cannot control every potential institutional challenger—domestic or international—though they often attempt to do so. At a domestic level, autocrats tolerate, restrict, or co-opt rival institutions to maintain power and legitimacy. This juggling act is not limited exclusively to domestic actors. Absolute state sovereignty is far more porous than some theoretical frameworks predict, and as a result, foreign nations and non-state actors can have significant influence on domestic politics and policies—and vice versa: regimes also limit and co-opt transnational civil society institutions. 

Future theoretical and empirical work can build on this more nuanced and bidirectional relationship. For example, what are the determinants and boundaries of the power dynamic in the relationship between the state and civil society? When will the regime dominate? When will civil society dominate? What happens when there is no outright domination and the two institutions battle for prominence? The literature hints at a few possible explanations, such as the existence of ties to foreign sponsors [@Yerkes:2012] or the shape of an organization's internal managerial structures [@Wong:2012], but further research can lead to a more formalized causal theory.

More work needs to be done on the influence of target country politics on INGO and NGO strategies in authoritarian regimes. Throughout this review I have highlighted the need to look at organizational level dynamics between the state and its rival and constitutive institutions. However, as an institution, civil society is embedded in a network of other institutions and not simply an isolated force that interacts with the state. How does an authoritarian parliament engage with civil society? What effect do competitive or noncompetitive electoral systems have on NGO effectiveness? Can civil society organizations find formal allies for their advocacy work through judicial politics or legislative lobbying? Again, this literature hints at possible mechanisms—the norms of philanthropy, notions of organizational efficiency, and attitudes toward the government of an INGO's home country all have an effect on its strategies [@Stroup:2012]—but little work has looked at the impact of the target country's political environment and networks on civil society effectiveness. 

Finally, additional research can be done on the relationship between domestic and international NGOs. @Buthe:2011 have shown that institutional complementarity is critical for successful global policymaking—nations with institutions that best match the structures of global rule-making bodies are best able to ensure that their policy preferences become global standards. A similar argument could be made for civil society, building on the work of @Bob:2005. How does institutional complementarity facilitate links between NGOS and INGOs? What behavioral or structural changes do domestic civil society organizations make to gain the support of transnational allies? Does this dynamic work in reverse? Do INGOs change their strategies to form better links with civil society organizations in target countries?

These new lines of research can enhance and expand existing institutional theory, deepening our knowledge of authoritarian politics and non-state actors. Additionally, research into these questions can provide useful policy guidance for international donors and transnational activists, providing mechanisms and strategies than can improve and enhance INGO effectiveness in authoritarian regimes.
