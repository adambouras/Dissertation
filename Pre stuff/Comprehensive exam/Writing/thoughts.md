Realism in IR ignores domestic politics


Regime durability + INGO effectiveness literatures and theories

Emulate Brownlee's introduction - connect institutionalism with INGO work and civil society - explain that there are divergent outcomes in cases because of institutions

Emphasize informalness of civil society as an institution - note 10 on page 29 in Brownlee:2007 shows the DPI - it is a standard scale of institutionalization, only measures legislature, executive, and judicial stuff - but informal institutions matter too - not just informal (like footbinding, FGM), but laws that are codified and dictate stuff - like civil society

Justify why civil society, participation in global civil society counts as institutional stuff

Authoritarian use of civil society helps explain INGO and civil society effectiveness
Using (I)NGOs and civil society institutions can be a tool for regime stability and cohesion

---

Include anecdote of LDS church in China, Egypt (though not technically a HR/advocacy TNA) - Mubarak was fine with us, but didn't allow it because he deferred to Copts; some other arrangement in China - demonstrates multilevel game aspect of authoritarianism

E-mail Kirk, Dil, ME desk, Elder Holland? 

Look up stuff on foreign churches in Egypt, China

---

Use comparative politics to inform, explain IR stuff, transnational actors


---

Hypothesis for a chapter? Connect domestic civil society restrictions to relations with INGOs; there's maybe some relationship - like number of INGOs that operate ~ restrictions

Get data from Aseem Prakash, or create own data?

---

Maybe talk about civil society before authoritarianism - ideals of civil society, then Gramsci, then competitive authoritarianism and use of NGOs for stability, co-optation like Yerkes:2012…

Potential sections - ideals of civil society (civil society in west vs. Arab world like Nefissa:2005); global civil society; link between domestic and international civil society (like institutional complementarity?, complex interdependence? Talk about realism first, how it purposely delinks domestic and international politics - then look at constructivism, liberalism, etc. leads to complex interdependence, then institutional complementarity); institutional stuff (Platteau stuff); competitive authoritarianism (authoritarian regimes are not omnipotent); inklings of new theory and policy issue area; contributions, what's missing in the different fields, what I can add



# Brownlee:2007

Institutions keep authoritarians in power (or not) - they use pseudo democratic practices to balance elites - in Brownlee's book, it's parties that do this - everything hinges on parties. Does engagement with foreign global civil society work that way too? A mediating factor? (Like how Blaydes:2011 shows how elections act like that?)

Look at history of engagement with global civil society in China, Egypt, other cases (4 cases like Brownlee?)

institutions are “the nerve center of authoritarianism” (p. 10)


# BarryBellClay:2015

HROs and INGOs matter and produce real world consequences for elites and the downtrodden


# Stacher:2012

Opening up to INGOs and civil society is a form of "controlled opening"(22) and method of adaptation? A form of "upgrading" authoritarianism?

HPC and PS - co-opted intellectuals into the service of the regime - same idea behind the whole nationalize domestic civil society thing


# LevitskyWay:2010

No Egypt or China in their study - could do them on my own?

What's the difference between competitive authoritarianism and whatever Egypt and China have? Just the year - 1990–1995 - also they're full authoritarian

Still though? Definition of full = Opponents don’t see these institutions as a viable means to achieve power. But opponents did in 2012 and MB won, and Sabahy came close, and Sabahy is actually unironicaly running for president now

19 - China and the ME escaped lots of this pressure because of their importance (economic and security)


They link international links with domestic institutional stuff - I can too

44 - civil society linkages, includes ties to NGOs and religious and party organizations, other transnational network stuff


# Brumberg:2002

Variation in autocracy a function of regime survival strategies, institutional conditions that intensify or reduce threats

"To endure, they must implicitly or explicitly allow some opposition forces certain kinds of … power—but things must never reach a point where the regime feels deterred from using force when it seems fit"

Looks at regime use of Islamist movements as a tool for regime survival - can do the same with INGOs and civil society

Juggling act of regime survival

**BOOM** "The sheer proliferation of small NGOs… has made 'divide and rule' easier"


# Gandhi:2006 

Dictators mobilize cooperation to stay in power by either granting policy concessions or distributing rents - places where rents are distributed have less civil society? Allowing INGOs to work is a reflection of policy concessions?

Legislatures are a good instrument of dictatorial institutional control


# GandhiPrzeworski:2007

Institutions in authoritarian regimes have a reason to exist - they respond to threats, are rarely just window dressing

# MaleskySchulerTran:2012

Transparency and sunshine not always great because of how institutions work differently - article not directly applicable, but it's an example of showing how weird things happen in authoritarian regimes *because* of how they work funny. INGOs and civil society work differently in authoritarian regimes also *because* of distinct weird patterns - authoritarianism all about maintaining stability by mediating elites, other groups - transparency risky. INGOs also risky unless used strategically?

# Wintrobe:1990

Tinpot regimes most applicable - balance between loyalty and repression - allowing INGOs and civil society is an example of increased loyalty, but it's a strategic decision (shown with fancy math here)

# Svolik:2009

Game between authoritarian and ruling coalition, with authoritarian trying to gain power relative to the coalition - strategically deferring to the Christian council about LDS, others is an example of this happening?

# Weiss:2013

Use of international civil society a sort of credible commitment like antiforeign protests?
This is cool - explains why autocrats allow potentially destabilizing stuff to happen
!!!


# Kelley:2004

**THIS BOOK**, but for INGOs

Domestic factors act as a filter for international pressures - how does that work with INGOs? What role do local NGOs play in that? How do INGOs work with NGOs to get around(?) the weirdness of authoritarianism?

Study policy as a dependent variable - find one to look at…

Section on domestic opposition on p. 47

(Look at Risse-Kapper 1994 for how domestic structures account for the variation in the impact of policy ideas)

(Also look at Moravcsik 2000 - domestic politics actually facilitate outside influence - some governments are eager for external mechanisms that lock in their preferences - they delegate to outside institutions to combat future threats to domestic democratic governance)

Because of that, newer, less-established democracies are the most receptive to external human rights obligations (so they can lock them in; but what about authoritarians? Do they do that too to some extent or in some domains?)

See if there are specific INGOs that tend to work in specific authoritarian countries more - have a more privileged status - what do they have to do to get that status? (related to p. 51 in book)

# Kelley:2004a

More than just the ruling regime has a stake in policy outcomes influenced by international organizations - other groups too (like domestic civil society in my case…)

Frame this as a way that INGOs can influence domestic policy? But find policies… track civil society laws in different countries… find INGOs that work on civil society policy?

Maybe International Republican Institute (IRI)? But that's democracy building… but maybe that's okay


# Kelley:2012

International meddling in domestic affairs again
Monitors are prone to domestic pressures

Do human rights INGOs actually have an impact? There's a lot of research on that (Murdie, etc.)

Find a subset of human rights INGOs - legal advising ones maybe, like Hisham Mubarak Law Center or whatever? Media-related NGOs - freedom of speech - EFF? Freedom of Expression laws, advocacy - HUGE list here: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/01/civil-society-egypt-release-alaa-abd-el-fattah-and-all-unjustly-detained-egypt

**Policies to maybe look at**: blogger vs. journalist policies, blogger/journalist arrests?

Why do governments allow monitors, even when they plan on cheating? Similar to my questions—why allow INGOs in the first place?

Authoritarian institutions and survival - they call the shots?

21 - Robert Dahl and core attributes of democracy - civil society linked to that? The idea of freedom of expression and participatory rights?

History of rise of civil society maybe? Or has that been done enough? History of civil society under authoritarianism?


# Kelley:2012a

Scholars have overlooked international influences on democratization, domestic politics

International influences on stuff hasn't been completely ignored, but focused on military intervention, sanctions, and political conditionality - it's more complicated than that



---

Sisi gives huge donation to his own foundation: http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/105704.aspx

Does authoritarian support of civil society help mitigate challenges from elites or from the public? Does the international nature of INGOs affect that decision or calculus?


---


# Buthe:2004

Mention that I'm looking at only one issue area, hoping to apply empirical findings to the larger question of private authority in the international public sphere?

Have freedom of expression organizations tried to establish best practices or standards for laws regarding expression? EFF and others working domestically put pressure on Google against Chinese self-censorship, Twitter blocking, etc.?


# Tarrow:2001

Specify the groups I'm looking at - not a social movement, but NGOs, which can be encouraged by the state - transnational social movements are beyond the state, but rare - NGOs are thus more state-based (see those early civil society articles by UK guy)

This is perfect! Look at how INGOS gain access to the political system of authoritarian regimes and how they contribute to policy coalitions - create a specific model for foreign/domestic NGOs in authoritarian states

When reviewing historical and sociological institutionalism stuff, tie it into the authoritarian and INGO research like this? Paving the way? Providing a bridge between literatures? Institutionalism opens up a big field of interdisciplinary, cross-area research

Globalization too confused with different meanings - led to ignorance of the regional {and domestic} side of transnational actives (DO THIS: This has been a problem, not looking at the domestic effects}

Link between global and domestic civil society; EFF providing norms, other smaller ones following those norms?


# Price:2003

Transnational civil society tries not just to change the interests and identities of actors, but also the environments they work in, generally looked at as norms. (DO THIS: Look at how environment has changed in ME?)


# Buthe:2011

Institutional complementarity between domestic and international institutions - cool idea, applicable in all sorts of other places

Nice historical institutionalist approach looking at historical institutional legacies - domestic institutions worked fine until they were confronted with globalization, then some became inferior - like Kuran's argument of Islamic banking


# Platteau:2000

Civil society helps maintain moral order and norms

“A civil society helps to back trust whenever there is a sufficient number of citizens who feel vengeful enough to work towards exposing publicly the illegal acts of malpractices of both private and state agents, and towards bringing enough pressure to sanction them even though such actions entail significant costs to themselves (by denouncing economic crimes they produce a public good).” - very similar to Weingast:1997 and institutions solving coordination dilemmas - see PolSci 715 proposal

Is there an absence of trust in authoritarian regimes? If so, does the creation/establishment of foreignish civil society (like freedom of expression, other human rights) come out of order in the evolution of economic growth? Or is there really an order? No order… lots of different things can be challenges (see Russia vs. subsaharan Africa in conclusion)


# TsutsuiWotipka:2004

Has anyone looked at IR effects of freedom of expression NGOs?

Connection between local and international NGOs

Domestic opportunities leads to more participation in INGOs - but mostly international factors do that - only domestic political opportunity structures help


# SmithWest:2005

Like TsutsuiWotipka:2004, "national contexts shape the opportunities for citizens to participate in transnational political associations"

The state still matters - conditions the possibilities to engage in transnational political associations - democracies are better represented 
**NB** Risse-Kappen:2005 = the more an issue area is regulated by international norms of cooperation, the more permeable state boundaries are for transnational activities


# Stiles:2002

Intermestic circles are a kind of way around state restrictions - INGOs and NGOs doing their own policies - can replace the state in weak states

Combines INGOs and domestic INGOs, moves beyond transnationalism

How do these intermestic circles work under strongish authoritarianism though? Dynamic of authoritarians trying to control domestic institutions, using them for stability vs. domestic + international civil society trying to do its own thing

Utility of a patron idea - useful to have a powerful foreign INGO to back you up against the government (is EFF like this?)

Institutional effects of linking to donor organization! Changing mission, professionalization, isomorphism, etc.

Obviously no super tight clubs of NGOs in the ME - perhaps because of competitive authoritarianism? They have better control over NGO activities?


# DeMars:2005

Bungie cord effect - government controls NGOs for reasons on p. 29

NGOs have a much more powerful and complicated effect on world politics than just doing stuff - they change and reshape the game; they're pawns in the game too

Like the US using NGOs for its foreign policy in Serbia/Yugoslavia, and vice versa


# Spires:2012

Cautionary tale of importing imperial nonprofit management training into China - overprofessionalization from a sector that is completely isomorphic.


# Simmons:2009

Treaties reflect *and alter* politics, kind of like DeMars:2005

Treaties define expectation gaps for coordinated understanding of watchdog organizations - space for NGO operation is not defined solely by domestic government (like I said in 715 paper), but by external forces too - they give domestic watchdogs something to rally behind - political mobilization domestic mechanism on pages 14–15 - same idea as 715 paper, but without the cool institutional theories

Authoritarians will still disregard these commitments when they feel it necessary

Ooh, cool pseudo model: rationally expressive ratification = variance in commitment to treaties ~ government preferences + domestic governing institutions + varying incentives for strategic ratification - make whatever my theory is really clear like this

**NB** She makes a case that domestic governments aren't in total control over what happens - authoritarians might let INGOs in strategically initially, but then politics (agendas, litigation, mobilization) change - they lose control


# Bob:2005

Competitive NGO marketplace - why do some INGOs link with domestic NGOs - rational decision based on domestic NGO characteristics, but also more complicated (like network connections in Carpenter:2014, others), relationships with domestic regime, home country (see Stroup:2012)

What do domestic NGOs do to market themselves, link up with INGOs?

Benefits of linking up with foreign supporters and INGOs


# Arthur:1994

See Pierson:2000, it's better, less economic, more political, and more modern


# KeohaneNye:2001

Complex interdependence blurs the distinction between domestic and international politics


# Wickham:2002

Social movement theory - movement leaders make mobilization possible, not just anger - under what conditions does mobilization become possible under authoritarianism? Why Islam and not secularism? 

This is kind of like Bob:2005, focusing on movement leaders and the things they do to gain support - this is just at a domestic level, no international stuff other than the impact the MB has on neighboring Islamist movements

**NB**: Idea that authoritarian regimes are better equipped and more determined to shut down opposition - but that might be oversimplified - authoritarians actually face a complicated balance of power - assumes authoritarian omnipotence

MB ascendency was based on the regime’s forbearance - cool idea, but still assumes authoritarian omnipotence

Islamic activism only worked after the state retreated

Mubarak tolerated the parallel Islamic sector = selective accommodation

Cycle of mobilization - NGOs were helpful in the revolution, then cracked down on because of the new political environment? Or maybe they don't even have to have been helpful - just a new kind of operating environment?


# Brownlee:2012

Addresses LevitskyWay:2010 in fn 24 on p. 181 - shows how the US became invested in Egyptian authoritarianism over time - those strategic interests can change over time in response to international or domestic events - also, he argues authoritarian regimes with international support aren't necessarily immune from democratizing pressure (see #jan25), but that the US has not applied significant democratization pressure in Egypt, doing the opposite instead

MEPI and tamed intervention - the US didn't do anything drastic with NGOs


# Carapico:2002

Foreign assistance to democratization doesn't involve governmental actors; they don't have control over it

Backlash against foreign funding in after the 1990s - authoritarians wanted monopolies over the production of political information (how does media and freedom of expression fit into this?)

Different government reactions to foreign help - embrace + GONGOs + legislation + smear campaigns + public trials


# Nefissa:2005

It’s hard to create a democratic civil society “within a social, family, educational, and religious system characterized by hierarchical and authoritarian values"

Main difference between Western and Arab NGOs is organizational - Western NGOs are self-organized; Arab ones are organized by states - para administrative (except advocacy ones, generally)

NGOs in Arab world = “a channel of communication between the administration and society, an area where social and political recognition emerge and serves as an electoral base"

Arab civil societies work perversely - they are a tool of the state’s administration

NGOs are conflated with civil society and are the poster child for it - but “they are a far cry from the real demands of civil society"


# Milani:2005

Good definition of governance as networks with actors - NGOs participate as nodes


# Roca:2005

Trust in NGOs isn’t because of what they stand for, but because of what they let people avoid - the state - “everything for which the state is being blamed is being transferred to the credit of NGOs, without taking anything else into consideration.”

Lots of Southern and Eastern NGOs have copied the dominant NGO model - like a hermit crab, with any association that organizes itself calling itself an NGO


# Denoeux:2005

“‘Supply-side’ assistance strategies are often a necessary complement to ‘demand-oriented’ ones" - under authoritarianism, just doing demand side stuff like civic participation won't help

“Where Arab regimes have opened up the political system, civil society has moved very quickly to occupy the political space created by the retreating authoritarianism”

Arab governments have had more to do with creating and promoting civil society than civil society has had to do with democratizing governments


# FouadRefatMurcos:2005

NGOs not just a passive force under the control of the government - they led a concerted campaign to lobby for changes in the NGO law


# Pratt:2005

Advocacy organizations as counter hegemonic forces - all about hegemony


# PrakashGugerty:2010a

Advocacy NGOs are special firms that function in policy markets


# Henderson:2010

252 - Domestic and international policies and actions can shape and define the demand for advocacy - Russia is a cool counterpoint example to the Middle East

There's a need to look at how civil society is shaped by state policies (GugertyPrakash:2010)


# HulmeEdwards:1997a

State-donor-NGO triangle

Some SNGOs have become so involved in service delivery that the local associations they create help the NGOs but not the poor; some NNGOs have become so involved with donor lobbying that they are simply lobbyists and politicians and not advocates for the poor


# Marzouk:1997

Even though there has been a rise in NGOs, these reforms have really just been a “reorganization of existing structures of state authority” - evolution of NGOs is just a temporary solution imposed by economic recession and political crisis - has resulted in “an NGO sector which is deformed, unable to become a real engine of democratization"

This is kind of like a really old version of my argument (how the political environment has shaped Middle Eastern NGOs), but without the new developments of competitive authoritarianism, everything else - this is old, needs to be updated


# RisseSikkink:1999

Model for how international norms can change state behavior - focused on just the right to life and freedom from torture in the UDHR - there's a right to freedom of expression though… could look at this

Spiral model under authoritarianism? They say it should have the same outcome (RisseRopp:1999) - Isn’t this another kind of modernization theory though? A teleological line towards rule consistent behavior?

Spreading international norms to the domestic level requires networks between domestic and transnational actors + international regimes - three things networks should do

“International norms are more likely to be implemented and complied with in the domestic context, if they resonate or fit with existing collective understandings embedded in domestic institutions and political cultures." (RisseRopp:1999)


# Granzer:1999

Having civil society in authoritarianism doesn’t mean much - they don’t have enough power to address issues form the inside alone - mobilization has to be supported from the outside

“Ben Ali was successful in instrumentalizing the moral legitimacy of the human rights idea to stabilize the existing authoritarian state apparatus"
