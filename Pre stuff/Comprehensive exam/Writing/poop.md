In the mid-1980s, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS, or Mormons) sought official permission to operate in Egypt in order to open the door to the services of LDS Charities and LDS Humanitarian Services—church-owned aid organizations that provide wheelchairs, eyeglasses, school kits, and neonatal resuscitation training programs in developing countries. Church lawyers met regularly with President Mubarak to 

Similarly, the experience of the LDS Church attempting to gain formal recognition in Egypt illustrates how autocrats can use INGOs to offset other domestic rivals to their power—Mubarak used an INGO's legal status as a tool to placate his rivals in the Coptic community.


Institutions can evolve over time in response to the actions of players in society, exogenous shocks, or self-undermining activity^[For example, ]. Institutional evolution is slow, however, and can depend on the relative payoffs of alternative institutional arrangements. For example, Kuran [-@Kuran:2004; -@Kuran:2011] argues that Islamic legal prescriptions for inheritance and capital accumulation established in the Middle Ages worked so well that Middle Eastern merchants had little incentive to dabble in alternative arrangements and thus failed to develop innovations such as the firm or modern banking system [see also @Greif:2006].


Institutions do not lower transaction costs for all players equally—different institutional arrangements have different distributional consequences. 

What's new about Knight? Different institutions have different distributional consequences - that's not absent in the other stuff we've read, but it wasn't emphasized 
North's central argument (and @Kuran:2004 too) = institutions raise expected gains by reducing transaction costs - focus is on the overall gains resulting from the institution
That aspect is underplayed in Knight—that matters. North is about how institutions affect the size of the cake; Knight ignores the size of the cake, looks at how institutions divide the cake differently, what the distributional consequences are

**ASDF**: Civil society and distributional stuff - Hansmann 

These groups and organizations exist to address market failures and improve the allocation of public goods when the government is unable to do so efficiently [@Hansmann:1980].



Looking at civil society as an institution not only provides a strong theoretical framework (as institutional theory has long been used on more traditional institutions), it informs research on more conventional institutions. The typology of capture, co-optation, and pluralism applies well to authoritarian parliaments and elections: elected parliamentarians can be fully captured by the regime and beholden to state interests, as shown by @Blaydes:2011, or, as seen by the Muslim Brotherhood's electoral victories [@Wickham:2002], they can pose a pluralistic threat to the regime.




In addition to concerns of reputation and domestic stability, regimes can also turn to international authority to lock in their existing policy preferences.  (Also look at Moravcsik 2000 - domestic politics actually facilitate outside influence - some governments are eager for external mechanisms that lock in their preferences - they delegate to outside institutions to combat future threats to domestic democratic governance - Kelley:2004 too)




However, once again, the relationship between INGOs and states is bidirectional—regimes can co-opt transnational civil society for their own purposes. Additionally, competitive dynamics and organizational characteristics within INGOs influence the direction of that relationship. 



@Denoeux:2005; 85 - It’s easier for donors to be politically neutral by supporting state institutions instead of choosing specific NGOs

TsutsuiWotipka:2004 - more membership in domestic human rights NGOs
