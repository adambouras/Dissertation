Hello,

I'm a doctoral student at Duke University in the United States and I am
conducting a research project about international NGOs and the laws and
regulations of the countries they work in. A while ago, I invited you to
participate in a global survey of international NGOs. Several hundred NGOs
have participated so far, but *your participation would be very valuable.*

The survey is about 15 minutes long and lets you share your insights about the
work {0} has done internationally and its relationship with the governments of
the countries it works in. If you are interested, I'll share a summary of the
results with you once the survey is complete. All your responses will remain
anonymous.

You can access the survey at https://www.ingoresearch.org/ or
https://duke.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_abHCZewmEEJZLZb. I would be so grateful
if you could complete the survey by **{1}**.

If you don't like taking surveys, or if you would rather speak via phone or
Skype, I would love to talk with you to learn more about your organization's
experiences. Reply to this e-mail and we can schedule a one-on-one conversation
if you have time.

If you feel unqualified to answer the survey questions, could you please let me
know if there is a particular person in your office who would be willing to
complete the survey or speak with me?

Thanks!

invitation and one reminder a week later.
