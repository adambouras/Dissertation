    manual_changes: >-
        This was originally a Google spreadsheet that I downloaded as an Excel
        workbook. Google's conversion isn't perfect, though, and R's
        readxl::read_excel chokes on it (sheet names and numbers are
        inexplicably mismatched). Also, there are two columns named "region3",
        which R's dplyr doesn't like. Thus, I made two manual changes:
        (1) removed the duplicate "region3" column and (2) resaved as a new
        xlsx file.
